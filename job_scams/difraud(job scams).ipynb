      "('posted by Eddie Gun man have stolen a Dirty Bomb by force in Mexico and now the bomb can be on its way into the United States. Why is the media remaining silent on such an issue? I do not have any idea, but i know that mainstream media is controlled by 6 giant corporations….. so it raises my curiosity even more. A device containing radioactive substances including cesium-37 and americium-beryllium, was stolen from a government research facility in Mexico. Authorities are currently working to track down the group of men who grabbed the device Sunday night during an assault on a National Construction Laboratory warehouse in Tultitlan, Mexico state.', 'President Donald Trump\\'s 2018 budget asks Congress to construct 60 miles of new border walls along the U. S. border — all of which would be located in Texas. [The plan is for the Rio Grande Valley Sector to receive 32 miles of a new border wall, and 28 miles of a new levee wall. The levee in Hidalgo County is designed to address flooding. The budget refers to the new border wall as \"a physical wall. \" Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said, \"We are absolutely dead serious about the wall. \" He called it one of President Trump\\'s \"top three\" budget priorities, reported Breitbart News on Tuesday. Mulvaney denied that the administration was scaling back funding for border walls by saying the Trump administration\\'s budget was a striking hike from the 2017 budget. The 2018 budget increases allocations for border security by $1. 1 billion, and $1. 5 billion for the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The director of the Office of Management and Budget also urged Trump voters to be patient and said this proposed action was a beginning for a project that will be protracted. \"Keep in mind you can\\'t just … you don\\'t automatically magically build a wall in the middle of nowhere,\" the director stated. The budget for the U. S. Department of Justice also asks for $1. 8 million to \"meet litigation, acquisition, and appraisal demands during the construction along the border between Mexico and the United States. \" Breitbart News reported that the funds would be used to hire 12 attorneys and eight staff members for the section of the DOJ that defends litigation arising from eminent domain proceedings (the Environmental and Natural Resources Division\\'s Land Acquisition Section, \"LAS\"). Those who are fighting the construction of border walls are mostly on partisan lines. Democratic U. S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( ) said \"Putting taxpayers on the hook to pay for it is just the latest brick in a wall of broken campaign promises. If we are going to pour billions into concrete, it ought to be an investment in ourselves, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure,\" reported Dallas\\' WBAP 820 AM on Thursday. However, landowners in Texas say they will fight mightily to keep their property, and they hope the litigation will be protracted beyond any Trump administration tenure. The New York Times report also said there are more than 90 eminent domain lawsuits from landowners in South Texas and they have been pending since 2008. The Dallas radio station reported that Senator John Cornyn ( ) who serves as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee\\'s Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration said, \"If we really want to secure our borders, and I think the voters in this last presidential election indicated they did, we must be willing to devote the necessary level of funding to achieve it. \" Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

The fuel shortage in Yemen has become critical under the Saudi-led coalition s blockade, partially lifted this week, leaving water systems in nine cities without fuel to run pumps, ICRC spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said. As a last resort and in light of the large and urgent needs...we are purchasing fuel to supply the urban water corporations in Hodeidah and Taiz with fuel, enough to operate their water pumps for one month, Jaquemet told Reuters. The ICRC is buying 750,000 liters of fuel for the two cities, she said, calling it an exceptional stop-gap measure . The lack of fuel has a cascading impact on several vital sectors - water and sanitation as well as health and food, as prices have risen sharply, she said. Fuel is needed to transport goods and run hospital generators and maintain cold chains for vaccines and medicines. Saudi Arabia and its allies closed air, land and sea access to the Arabian Peninsula country on Nov. 6, to stop what it calls a flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. The action came after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired towards its capital Riyadh. Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with weapons. A first aid ship, carrying 5,500 tonnes of flour docked in the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah on the Red Sea on Sunday. Humanitarian aid has started coming in and it s a very welcome first step but we need commercial imports, Jaquemet said. ICRC trucks have brought medical material into Yemen this week, mainly badly needed dialysis material, she said. A shipment of kits for treating trauma patients is expected to berth in Aden shortly, she added. These war-wounded kits will enable surgeries for over 400 people and are to be distributed to 10 hospitals and 15 field hospitals across north and south Yemen. The ICRC is stepping up assistance to combat an outbreak of diphtheria in Ibb governorate, including protective equipment for hospital staff to avoid spread of the highly-infectious respiratory disease, she said. Some suspected cases and 20 deaths have been recorded in 13 governorates, more than 80 percent in Ibb, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday. Yemen is also reeling from a cholera epidemic, with 960,065 suspected cases and 2,219 deaths reported since April, according to the latest WHO figures.', 'Australia will not be allowed to walk away from legal, financial and moral responsibility for nearly 800 men when it closes its asylum seeker detention center in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on Tuesday, PNG s immigration minister said. Human rights advocates are warning of a looming humanitarian crisis when the Manus Island center closes if the men are not properly resettled, with hundreds of the detainees refusing to leave the center for fear of being targeted by locals. PNG Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas said late on Sunday that Australia will remain responsible for the welfare of the men that have been detained in the Australian-funded center for more than four years. Australia refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, detaining them in camps in PNG and Nauru in the South Pacific. The United Nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centers. It is PNG s position that as long as there is one individual from this arrangement that remains in PNG, Australia will continue to provide financial and other support to PNG to manage the persons transferred under the arrangement until the last person leaves or is independently resettled in PNG, Thomas said in an emailed statement. Australia has already said it would spend up to A$250 million ($195 million) housing the nearly 800 refugees and asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea for the next 12 months after its controversial detention center closes. The Manus center is scheduled to close on Tuesday, after being declared illegal by a PNG court, with 600 men set to be moved to three new transit camps. Just under 200 men have already relocated. Despite threats that basic services like electricity and water will be cut off, the remaining detainees are refusing to move, citing fears for their safety. Fears of violence have been stoked further after PNG sent extra security forces to the camp. The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of refugees as part of a refugee swap deal. The United States has agreed to take up to possibly 1,250 refugees from Australia s two Pacific detention centers, but so far only 25 men from Manus have been resettled. In exchange, Australia said it will resettle Central American refugees. Australia has said those detainees not resettled in the United States will be allowed to stay in PNG or the tiny Pacific island of Nauru. But nearly all have refused invitations to settle permanently in both locations. Thomas said PNG will not force anyone to remain. It is the responsibility of Australia to pursue third country options, he said. Australia s acting Prime Minister Julie Bishop said on Monday that Canberra was exploring possible deals for resettlement, but added those who have found not to be refugees should go home . They ve been found by the (United Nations) not to be owed protection so they should return to their homes, she said. The bulk of the detainees come from war-torn countries such as Syria and Afghanistan, and Pakistan, Iran, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.', 'The Uzbek man arrested in the terrorism rampage in central Stockholm last week was an asylum seeker whose application was rejected and who in December was given four weeks to leave the country, the Swedish police said on Sunday. The suspect, 39, had shown \"sympathy for extremist organizations,\" the police said. He applied for permanent residency in 2014, and the Swedish Migration Agency denied his application in June 2016, officials said. The police tried to find him in February of this year to execute the exit order, but he had gone underground, becoming a wanted man, Jonas Hysing, the national strategic commander, said at a news conference on Sunday at the Stockholm police headquarters. \"We know that he has shown sympathy for extremist organizations like I. S.,\" Mr. Hysing said, referring to the Islamic State terrorist group. On Friday, the man was arrested on suspicion of driving a stolen beer truck that was used to mow down a crowd of people, killing four and injuring 15 others. On Sunday, the police released more information about the victims after informing their next of kin. The dead included two Swedish citizens, one Briton and one Belgian, said Jan Evensson, the strategic commander of the Stockholm police. The father of the British victim told the Swedish newspaper Expressen that his son, Chris Bevington, 41, a senior manager at the streaming music service Spotify, died in the attack. \"We are devastated that our talented and thoughtful son Chris is dead,\" said the father, John Bevington, according to Expressen. The founder of Spotify, Daniel Ek, who is Swedish, said in a statement posted on his Facebook page that Chris Bevington had worked at Spotify for five years. \"There are no words for how missed he will be or for how sad we all are to have lost him like this,\" Mr. Ek wrote, adding, \"I am as deeply saddened and upset as all of you that something like this could happen in Sweden. \" The police have not provided any more information about the victims. A police spokesman, Kjell Lindgren, said a second person was being held on suspicion of participating in the attack. The assault, in a city known for its tolerance and openness, came after the Swedish Security Service, or Sapo, warned in March in its annual security report that a terrorist acting alone was likely to attack somewhere in the country within a year. Hans Brun, a security expert with the Swedish Defence University, said the police had worried about the possibility of such an assault. \"Unfortunately, this type of attack is something we have been discussing for years,\" he said, adding that the police, Sapo and other government agencies had long been preparing, resulting in a response on Friday. \"They put Stockholm under lockdown quite quickly,\" Mr. Brun said in a phone interview. \"They shut down the subway. They found the perpetrator quickly and, obviously, had some reliable intelligence quite early on. \" The danger is not only that this type of attack is hard to prevent, he said, but also that there are so many people who are willing to do it. \"Given the information that the Swedish Security Service has been providing in recent years, there are a couple of hundred people in Sweden who have the capability and the will to carry out these type of attacks,\" he said. Since 2010, when Taimour a disaffected Iraqi Swede, blew himself up on a side street just yards from where Friday\\'s attack took place, the threat level in Sweden has been three on a scale of five, where three indicates the possibility of an attack and five represents the most serious threat. Magnus Ranstorp, the head of terrorism research at the Swedish Defence University, said that while it was nearly impossible to deter these types of attacks, more could be done to deter potential terrorists. \"You need legislation that bites and is effective,\" he said. \"And that may be solved by criminalizing associating with a terrorist organization. \" Sweden has tightened its laws in recent years to prevent terrorism, and more changes are planned, said Anders Ygeman, the nation\\'s interior minister. \"We have taken the first step, criminalizing traveling to and fighting with a terrorist organization in another country or receiving terrorist training,\" Mr. Ygeman said. \"The next step is criminalizing participation that is not linked to killing — for example, being a chef for or supporting a terrorist organization in another way other than being a part of killing or making bombs. \" Mr. Ygeman said there was broad support in Sweden for this kind of law. As many as 300 people have gone from Sweden to Syria or Iraq to fight with the Islamic State, according to Sapo, and about half that number have returned. So far, there is nothing to indicate that the man in custody had been fighting alongside extremists, Mr. Ygeman said. But the Stockholm police said the man had been able to elude the authorities\\' attempts to deport him by giving them an incorrect address.', 'If you haven t noticed, no one associated with the Trump administration (including The Donald s mail-order bride) has any respect for people who aren t white fake Christians.Naturally, people thought it was a bit odd when Melania Trump announced she would be visiting schools to tell kids to be nicer to each other you know, since her husband spends the majority of his time treating black people, Latino(s)s, and pretty much everyone conservatives hate en masse, like trash.Donald Trump accuses African-Americans of racism three times more than he does whites and pushes dangerous lies originating with Nazi groups about black crime rates.During her visit to Orchard Lake Middle School in the suburbs of Detroit, Melania told kids to make sure everyone feels included a strange statement considering her husband s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the country, his attacks on African-Americans, and his decision to build a wall to keep Mexicans (whom he calls rapists and drug dealers ) from coming into the United States.

Among those who are slamming the GOP for this despicable act are doctors, who know just how bad this will be for their patients.Following the passage of the American Health Care Act, the American Medical Association issued a scathing statement. The AMA, which is the largest group of its kind in the U.S. and represents more than 20,000 physicians, slammed the bill for leaving millions without access to medical care. The bill passed by the House today will result in millions of Americans losing access to quality, affordable health insurance and those with pre-existing health conditions face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question, AMA President Andrew Gurman said.The group conceded that action is needed to improve the current health care insurance system. After all, no one has ever claimed that Obamacare was perfect. However, the GOP s bill is not the answer we need. The AMA urged the White House and the Senate to work toward bipartisan solutions. The AMA urges the Senate and the Administration to work with physician, patient, hospital and other provider groups to craft bipartisan solutions so all American families can access affordable and meaningful coverage, while preserving the safety net for vulnerable populations, he said.The CBO has estimated that 24 million people will lose their healthcare coverage under the Republican plan. The elderly and sick (you know, the people who need medical care the most) will be hit the hardest by the GOP bill. Under the AHCA, states will be able to gut protections for pre-existing conditions and tell insurance companies that they can charge sick people as much as they want, even if that means these people are priced out of coverage altogether.', \"The White House said on Saturday it had ordered that Iran, Venezuela and four African nations be added to a U.S. list of countries accused of failing to crack down on human trafficking, a step that further isolates them from the United States. The White House said it also was increasing restrictions on North Korea, Eritrea, Russia and Syria, which already were on the list, by constraining them from engaging in educational or cultural exchange programs with the United States. In addition, President Donald Trump's administration instructed the U.S. executive director of the International Monetary Fund and U.S. executive directors at other multilateral development banks to vote against extending loans or other funds to North Korea, Russia and Iran for fiscal year 2018, which begins on Sunday. Under a 2000 U.S. law called the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the United States does not provide non-humanitarian, non-trade-related foreign assistance to any country that fails to comply with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking and is not making efforts to do so. The White House said in a notice that Iran, Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Equatorial Guinea, South Sudan and Sudan had been added to the list of countries subject to these restrictions for the new fiscal year. The move came six days after Trump included Venezuela and Iran on a list of eight countries targeted for travel restrictions to the United States. The restrictions on Venezuela focused on government officials who the Trump administration blamed for the country's slide into economic disarray. The travel ban on Iranians was broader. That travel ban list lifted previous restrictions on citizens from Sudan.\", 'More than 50 female Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives called on Monday for a congressional investigation into allegations by various women of sexual misconduct against President Donald Trump, who has denied the accusations. \"We cannot ignore the multitude of women who have come forward with accusations against Mr. Trump,\" the lawmakers wrote in their letter, though a formal inquiry was unlikely to result because Republicans control the agenda in Congress. The letter, spearheaded by the Democratic women\\'s working group, which is composed of all the party\\'s female members in the House, was signed by 56 lawmakers. It followed a call earlier on Monday by three women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct for a congressional investigation into his behavior. The lawmakers\\' request for a probe was sent to leaders of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the main investigative committee in the House. Over the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them in the years before he entered politics. Monday\\'s letter from the Democrats said there were at least 17 accusers and listed names. \"The president\\'s own remarks appear to back up the allegations,\" the letter said, saying Trump had boasted \"that he feels at liberty to perpetrate such conduct against women.\" \"The president should be allowed to present evidence in his own defense,\" said the lawmakers. The letter was addressed to oversight panel Chairman Trey Gowdy, a Republican, and top Democrat Elijah Cummings. Trump last year apologized for talking about groping women in a 2005 tape recording that surfaced weeks before the presidential election, and said he had not done the things he talked about. More recently, Trump has told allies that the voice on the recording was not his, The New York Times reported recently. Trump and White House officials have denied the sexual misconduct allegations against him, some of which date back to the 1980s. \"These false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year\\'s campaign, and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.', 'One of Vladimir Putin\\'s closest friends said on Thursday he believed Donald Trump would be the next president of the United States and that Western leaders were no match for the Russian president. Sergei Roldugin, a childhood friend of Putin\\'s and godfather to his eldest daughter, made international headlines earlier this year after his name featured in the leaked Panama Papers as the owner of a sprawling network of offshore accounts. Some Western media said the papers suggested Roldugin, 64, was looking after Putin\\'s money. Putin called such reports \"a provocation\" and said Roldugin, a famous cellist, had done nothing wrong and spent the money he earned from business on buying expensive musical instruments. Speaking to reporters in the Kremlin on Thursday before Putin bestowed a state award on him, Roldugin said: \"I know who will win in America. You may check it later. Trump will win.\" He went on to say that politicians changed their behavior once they were in power. \"I can\\'t say I feel euphoria about Trump winning because he said he was with Putin and Hillary (Clinton) hasn\\'t said that. Putin has said he will work with either and he\\'s right.\" Trump, the Republican candidate, has been criticized by Clinton, his Democratic Party rival, for praising Putin as a strong leader and saying ties with Moscow should be improved at a time when Moscow and Washington are at odds over Syria and Ukraine. The Kremlin has tried to take a neutral stance on the U.S. election, saying it will respect the choice of the American people, though Kremlin-backed TV channels have tilted their coverage in favor of Trump, whom Putin called \"very talented.\" Roldugin told reporters Putin was a more impressive leader than his various Western counterparts. \"The one thing I\\'ve always admired about him is that he is not afraid to assume responsibility. He often comes under heavy criticism, but he is not afraid (of that) and says: \\'Yes that\\'s what we decided, that\\'s what I decided.\\'\" \"He is not afraid of taking responsibility, unlike many Western politicians and American politicians who, as far as I understand, can\\'t bring themselves to say \\'That\\'s what I decided and that\\'s how it will be.\\'\" Roldugin listed German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, and U.S. President Barack Obama as being guilty of not taking responsibility and of concealing the true nature of agreements they had struck.', 'Peru\\'s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski could end up the surprise winner of an attempt to oust him from power this week, after some opposition lawmakers broke ranks with party leaders to support him, opening a divide that might strengthen his hand. Despite having a Congressional majority, the rightwing opposition party Popular Force was unable to push through a motion to remove Kuczynski from office on Thursday, after 10 of its own lawmakers broke ranks to save the president. The vote cemented a growing divide in the opposition and looked to threaten its control over Congress, potentially aiding Kuczynski as he tries to restore political stability and revive investments in one of Latin America\\'s most robust economies. The surprise defection was the result of a deal struck between Kuczynski and Popular Force rebel lawmaker Kenji Fujimori to get his father and ex-president Alberto Fujimori out of prison, alleged Popular Force secretary general, Jose Chlimper. Over the past year, Kenji has courted Kuczynski\\'s center-right government while challenging his sister Keiko\\'s leadership of the rightwing populist movement that their father formed in the 1990s. In defiance of his sister, Kenji threw his support behind Kuczynski ahead of the vote on whether to remove him from office over unproven graft allegations. Nine other Popular Force lawmakers followed his lead. \"This is the birth of a serious and formal split (in the Fujimori movement),\" said Guillermo Loli, the head of political research for pollster Ipsos Peru. \"Everything points to a pardon,\" he added. Kuczynski\\'s government denied that a pardon for Fujimori was part of its political negotiations. In an address to the nation late on Friday, Kuczynski said he would spend the coming days reflecting on his year and a half in office. \"I\\'ll be announcing to you changes to make sure 2018 is not just a year of greater growth, but politically different,\" Kuczynski said. Efforts to reach the Popular Force lawmakers who defected were not successful. One, Clayton Galvan, said on local TV channel Canal N that Alberto Fujimori called them from prison to ask them to help Kuczynski stay in power. Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes, is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency during his 1990-2000 term. Freeing him would likely anger the well-organized foes of the Fujimori clan - a mix of technocrats, leftists, human rights activists and academics. \"The day (Kuczynski) signs a pardon, he loses all of those guys. Permanently,\" said Harvard University political scientist Steve Levitsky. Support from the anti-Fujimori crowd was key to Kuczynski\\'s razor-thin victory over Keiko in last year\\'s presidential election, and to keeping the motion to oust him from succeeding. \"Kuczynski was saved by two diametrically opposed political groups: Kenji\\'s group and the left, which opposes a pardon. He can\\'t please both of them,\" said Levitsky. Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former investment banker, took office amid hopes he would usher in cleaner government and faster economic growth. Instead, a graft scandal roiling Latin America has stalled investments and ensnared him in allegations of wrongdoing. Before the vote on Thursday, Kuczynski fanned fears of a return to Peru\\'s authoritarian past and described the motion as part of a legislative \"coup\" attempt by Keiko\\'s supporters. Popular Force denies the charge and says the bid to remove him was part of its fight against corruption and within the bounds of the constitution. A hardline Popular Force lawmaker loyal to Keiko, Hector Becerril, said the Kenji faction represented \"traitors.\" \"If they have any sense of decency after this vote, the least they could do is present their resignations,\" Becerril told journalists on Friday. \"Hopefully today.\" With 10 votes fewer, Popular Force would command 61 seats in the 130-member, single-chamber Congress, less than an absolute majority, though it would still be the biggest voting bloc. The political crisis has cost Kuczynski his interior minister, Carlos Basombrio, who announced his resignation on Friday. Kuczynski could make a decision about other Cabinet changes in coming days, his government said.', 'Donald Trump s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, doesn t just have trouble with grammar. Apparently, she struggles with American history as well.Following Trump s meeting with the leaders of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), DeVos sent out a tweet that can only be described as completely clueless. According to the new education secretary, HBCUs are pioneers of school choice. Wowwowwow. These paragraphs are from a real, official US Department of Education statement from Betsy DeVos released today. pic.twitter.com/I2FDZfzdmt Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) February 28, 2017DeVos couldn t have gotten things more backward if she had tried. Historically black schools aren t models of school choice. In fact, it is the exact opposite. These schools arose because there was no choice. Slaves were forbidden from learning how to read and write. Following their emancipation, most white schools refused to let black students in.The first HBCUs were started to educate black teachers so that black children would have a shot at receiving any type of education at all. Later, in addition to the private institutions that had been founded, southern states set up public colleges to serve blacks rather than integrate existing schools.If DeVos really believes this is something to aspire to, it certainly does explain a lot. As secretary of education, she plans to fix our broken education system by diverting federal funds from public schools to private schools, which are largely unregulated. Critics argue that this will serve only to accelerate the resegregation of American schools.Following the integration of public schools in America, white parents who didn t want their children to share classrooms with black students opted to send their children to private schools. In the decade following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, approximately half a million white students left public schools for private ones.Maybe DeVos isn t just an idiot with no understanding of history after all. Between her tweet and her vision for the future of American schools, we are forced to ask if taking our children and their education back to the days of Jim Crow has really been her intention all along.', 'Former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean hinted that President Donald Trump would not make it through his first term Friday on MSNBC s Morning Joe. Discussing Sen. Jeff Flake s (R., Ariz.) remarks that Trump could be inviting a 2020 Republican primary challenger with his conduct in office, Dean suggested Trump could no longer be president by then anyway.Watch: Who knows if Trump is going to be around in 2020? Of his own volition, I think it s unlikely he ll be impeached, even if the Democrats take over [the House], although [Robert] Mueller could unearth some stuff that could lead to that, Dean said. I think this is unpredictable. WFB', 'A huge number of federal employees wouldn t be able to stand their jobs if Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump won the next presidential election. According to a survey done by the Government Business Council, a quarter of government employees find Trump so unbearably repulsive that they would actually quit.The breakdown revealed that 14% of workers surveyed would definitely jump ship, and 11% stated that they d consider leaving their jobs resulting in a potential 25% of federal employees terminating their positions. It could be disastrous, when you imagine all the government agencies such as the post office and our VA system which are normally understaffed to begin with trying to function with 25% fewer people. The results of Trump s presidency could be damaging on every level.When broken down by party, 42% of Democrats said they d consider leaving, compared to just 8% of Republicans. The survey also revealed that regardless of their political party, almost 60% of federal employees admitted they d be embarrassed to call Trump their boss. This was much higher than any of the Democratic candidates such as Hillary Clinton (49%) and Bernie Sanders (37%).To make matters even more embarrassing for the GOP, survey participants were also asked how they felt about their current boss, President Barack Obama and the majority (56%) of Democratic employees said they would be honored to support him for a third term (if he was permitted one).So while Donald Trump might continue to be popular in the polls, this study reveals that many Americans are still level-headed and quite humiliated by the idea that he might be given the chance to lead this country. You can t get a much clearer sign than 1 in 4 people quitting their jobs to demonstrate just how vile the idea of Trump in the White House is.This poll was conducted at the end of January, and used data from 688 federal employees with a margin of error give or take four percentage points. Of those surveyed, 42% called themselves Republicans, 31% identified as Democrats, while 8% said they did not know and 19% wouldn t state their party.', 'Vietnamese police have ordered the prosecution of an official at scandal-hit state energy firm PetroVietnam over financial losses, the Ministry of Public Security said on Tuesday. PetroVietnam is at the heart of a sweeping high-level corruption crackdown in the communist state. The ministry said in a statement that Phan Dinh Duc, a member of PetroVietnam s board of directors, would face prosecution on suspicion of violation of state regulations on economic management, causing serious consequences . PetroVietnam told Reuters in an emailed statement it would cooperate with the authorities in the investigation. Former PetroVietnam chairman Dinh La Thang, 56, was arrested on Dec 8. Thang, also a former member of Vietnam s politburo, was the most senior executive arrested in the scandal. Police have said they are investigating alleged violations of state rules at PetroVietnam, which resulted in a loss of an 800 billion dong ($35.2 million) investment in local lender Ocean Bank. The corruption crackdown made global headlines in August when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former chairman of PetroVietnam s construction unit, in Berlin after he applied for asylum there. Vietnamese police denied he had been kidnapped saying he had turned himself in and returned to Vietnam, where he is in detention. The Communist Party has said Thanh will go on trial next month.', 'Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has asked one of America\\'s most ardent drilling advocates and climate change skeptics to help him draft his energy policy. U.S. Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota - a major oil drilling state - is writing a white paper on energy policy for the New York billionaire, Cramer and sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Cramer was also among a group of Trump advisers who recently met with lawmakers from western energy states, who hope Trump will open more federal land for drilling, a lawmaker who took part in the meeting said. Cramer said in an interview his paper would emphasize the dangers of foreign ownership of U.S. energy assets, burdensome taxes, and over-regulation. Trump will have an opportunity to float some of the ideas at an energy summit in Bismarck, North Dakota on May 26, Cramer said. A spokeswoman for Trump\\'s campaign did not comment. While the ultimate size and makeup of Trump\\'s energy advisory team is unclear, Cramer\\'s inclusion suggests the presumptive Republican presidential nominee\\'s oil policy could emphasize more drilling, less regulation and taxes, and curbs on efforts to combat climate change. Cramer has said he believes the Earth is cooling, not warming, and he has opposed efforts by the Obama administration to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has been light on details of his energy policy so far, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were in the White House. He has also claimed global warming is a concept \"created by and for the Chinese\" to hurt U.S. business. Trump only recently started building up teams of advisors on the economy, foreign policy and other issues to flesh out his platform for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Cramer, North Dakota\\'s only congressman and an early Congressional Trump supporter, encountered Trump when they were guests on a radio show last month and Trump spoke about relaxing regulation and expanding drilling. Trump\\'s political team later asked Cramer to write the energy policy paper, the lawmaker said. \"The real opportunity for prosperity in this country has been to produce more because you have access to more markets,\" Cramer said, referring to the recent lifting of a decades-old ban on oil exports. \"The last thing we need is more rules.\" On foreign ownership of U.S. oil assets, Cramer said: \"One-third of refining capacity is owned by OPEC countries. How does this fit into his (Trump\\'s) America first policy?\" OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela both have large stakes in U.S. refining capacity. Cramer said he expected energy policy to be a vulnerability for Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, in an election year where energy companies are going broke. Clinton has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies \"out of business.\"', 'In the past few weeks, the Islamic State has sustained a string of military defeats: ousted from its refuge on the Libyan coast, struggling to maintain its hold on the Iraqi city of Mosul, and losing ground in Syria. Yet as the deadly truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin made clear, those losses do not diminish the group\\'s extraordinary power to inspire terrorist mayhem around the world, and may even help fuel it. In just the past year, even while under near continuous bombardment by the coalition, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for more than three dozen attacks, stretching across 16 countries on four continents. That figure does not include the organization\\'s home terrain in Syria and Iraq, where it has lost 50, 000 fighters in the past two years, according to the Pentagon — nearly as many dead as the United States lost in the Vietnam War. Many of the attacks beyond the Middle East were carried out by assailants who cited their inability to reach the group\\'s Syria refuge, its caliphate, as a motive for acting at home. At the core of the Islamic State\\'s global success — and vulnerability — is a peculiar blend of theological boldness and criminal opportunism, something Al Qaeda, its predecessor and rival, never achieved. \"ISIS\\' claim to represent the caliphate has clearly been a trump card,\" said Bernard Haykel, a professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University, referring to the group by one of its acronyms. \"It stirs deep sentiments, even among those who are not converts to the cause, about a utopian and powerful Muslim empire, and one that seemed, for a while at least, to be unstoppable militarily. \" At the same time, the Islamic State has cannily lowered the bar for what passes as an attack. The Berlin truck rampage — like the deadly attack in Nice, France, in July — is a case in point. Both were as simple as it gets: The attackers commandeered trucks and plowed them into crowds of pedestrians. No weapons were needed (although the Tunisian suspected in the Berlin attack, who was killed in a shootout in Italy on Friday, is believed to have used a weapon to steal the truck). Al Qaeda began promoting exactly such a truck or car attack seven years ago, complete with illustrations, through a slick internet publication called Inspire. But there were no takers. \"For years, this kind of stuff was sniffed at,\" said William McCants, a scholar at the Brookings Institution. \"U. S. counterterrorism officials were long confused as to why this wasn\\'t happening. But ISIS has succeeded in doing what Al Qaeda never did — it\\'s an open invitation to wreak havoc. \" The Islamic State has had its share of good luck: The Syrian conflict that began in 2011 created a vast ungoverned zone that was virtually an invitation to seize and hold terrain, much as other jihadist groups had done for much shorter periods in Yemen and Afghanistan in years past. The emergence of the Islamic State came just as social media was in full bloom, and it benefited from an inflow of Western jihadist militants who could give its propaganda more reach and polish than any previous insurgent group. The Islamic State was also endowed with an unusual mix of military expertise — many of its core members were former Iraqi officers with plenty of battlefield experience — and religious erudition. Arriving when the Arab world seemed to be collapsing, it deftly marshaled the skills of a cadre of young, intelligent Islamic fundamentalists such as the Bahraini religious scholar Turki al Binali, who helped recruit many frustrated young people eager for a radical new source of hope. What looks to outsiders like nihilism is the opposite to many young Islamic State converts: They are genuinely thrilled to be taking part in a venture that aims to redraw the map and reverse the moral polarities of what they see as a fallen world. The caliphate has emerged, again and again, as the key motivating factor for terrorists in Europe, including Anis Amri, the Tunisian suspected of having carried out last week\\'s truck attack in Berlin. Some attackers, including some of those who struck in France this year, have cited their inability to reach Islamic State terrain in Syria as a source of deep frustration in their videotaped farewell statements, and a reason for striking on their home turf instead. The same goes for the Islamic State\\'s suicide bombers, whose numbers are an extraordinary testament to the group\\'s ideological power. The group\\'s primary news source said in early December that Islamic State fighters had carried out 1, 034 suicide attacks in 2016. That number is impossible to verify, but analysts agree that the total has been climbing for several years now. Even if that increase is largely because of the group\\'s defensive use of suicide bombers while under siege, the number of people willing — even eager — to sacrifice for the cause is staggering. When the political scientist Robert Pape wrote a book on suicide bombings in 2005, he counted a global total of 315, and that was over about 15 years. Yet the Islamic State\\'s dependence on the idea of the caliphate is also a risk. It was noteworthy that the group\\'s leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, urged followers in a November audiotape message not to abandon Mosul. That seemed to cut against earlier statements from the group, which had hinted that the Islamic State could withdraw and regroup in the desert if necessary. Mr. Baghdadi\\'s warning suggested that he feared military defeat would drain the group\\'s global cachet, leaving Al Qaeda to inherit the jihadist mantle. \"Once it loses its territory, ISIS will become another lost jihadist cause,\" Mr. Haykel said. \"Al Qaeda has the advantage of being an ideology that is not tied to a territory or an institution like the caliphate. \"', 'The famous drag queen, actor and recording artist Rupaul, claims that Donald Trump grabbed his ass and genitals during a party in 1995. In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Rupaul said that Mr Trump made a move on him during an event celebrating the release of the movie To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. The artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman. I had just come out of the bathroom when Trump jumped on me and kissed me, he explained. He started grabbing my ass and pulled my dress up to grab my genitals. He suddenly became very angry. He started yelling and cursing, and he left the party. Rupaul says he was dressed very sexy for the party and is convinced that Trump thought he was a woman. Rupaul says he found Donald Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity. Rupaul told the Hollywood Inquirer that Donald Trump moved on him during a party, grabbing his ass and genitals. He just wanted to use me as an object, he told Hollywood Inquirer. Ive never felt so dirty in my life! In a way, I was saved by the fact that Im a man. This allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump. Many women have come forward over the last week to denounce the abusive groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years. The New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumpss alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered. All these allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News. The comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show Access Hollywood. The remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation. You know Im automatically attracted to beautiful I just start kissing them. Its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait, Trump said. And when youre a star they let you do it. You can do anything. He added: Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything. In Rupauls case, Trump seems to have been disappointed by what he discovered under the dress.', '(CNN) The thing about women, Donald J. Trump once wrote, is that they \"have one of the great acts of all time.\" \"The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers,\" he continued. \"The person who came up with the expression \\'the weaker sex\\' was either very naïve or had to be kidding. I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye -- or perhaps another body part.\" The provocative passage, along with several others, is contained in a chapter devoted to women in Trump\\'s 1997 book, \"The Art of the Comeback.\" His words on women have newfound relevance in 2016 as Trump\\'s enigmatic relationship with the opposite sex is front and center in his campaign for President. The comments play on potential vulnerabilities for his likely general election opponent -- but they also highlight Trump\\'s own significant hurdles with female voters as he tries to win their votes in November. He went on to connect Clinton with her husband\\'s marital indiscretions. In a testy exchange, he told Cuomo he raised the issue as retribution for Clinton \"playing the woman\\'s card to the hilt\" in the campaign. Trump raised that notion last week during his victory speech in New York, suggesting her appeal to female voters, based solely on gender, was her only asset. \"She\\'s got nothing else going on,\" he said. The intense scrutiny of the campaign has also renewed interest in Trump\\'s crude banter about his sexual conquests and desires on Howard Stern\\'s radio show. His controversial remarks then and during the 2016 campaign have taken a toll on his image among female voters. The women standing by him But for all the women who have voiced their collective disapproval in polling numbers, those closest to the billionaire businessman insist he\\'s a model husband and father -- supportive, nurturing, and empowering. Some women who have worked for Trump offer a similar assessment: Despite his controversial public comments, he is a giving and inspirational boss, they say, and treats female employees no differently than their male counterparts. Still, it is difficult to paint a full portrait of Trump\\'s dealings with women, because many who have worked with him over the years have no interest in talking publicly about a candidate who has shown no hesitation in striking back at his critics. A number of Trump\\'s former female colleagues contacted by CNN did not return calls. Some refused to talk on the record. One prominent former Trump colleague hung up abruptly on a reporter, explaining that she had no interest in being hounded by the press. Hence, the lingering question: What\\'s the deal with Donald Trump and women? The perception that Trump has a problem with females stems, in part, from high-profile clashes over the years in which he\\'s called them names and ridiculed their appearance. Trump has said he loves women, finds them beautiful, and is not a sexist. Twice divorced by the time the book was published, Trump\\'s views on women were shaped by what he saw as the aggressive behavior of females around him. He wrote of a married socialite who propositioned him on a ballroom dance floor as her husband looked on and about a bride-to-be \"jumping on top of me wanting to get screwed\" in his limousine a week before she was due to be married. \"The level of aggression was unbelievable,\" he wrote of the dance floor incident. \"This is not infrequent, it happens all the time.\" \"Their sex drive makes us look like babies,\" he wrote of women at another point in the same book. Living up to his mother Trump opened the chapter on women by writing that part of \"the problem\" he has with them is \"having to compare them to my incredible mother, Mary Trump.\" He recalled his mom as \"smart as hell\" and as \"a really great homemaker and wife to my father.\" He came to see his mother\\'s supporting role as a model not just for his own situation, but for any man who wants to succeed. \"For a man to be successful he needs support at home, just like my father had from my mother, not someone who is always griping and bitching,\" he wrote. \"When a man has to endure a woman who is not supportive and complains constantly about his not being home enough or not being attentive enough, he will not be very successful unless he is able to cut the cord.\" The passage did not explore the possibility of a woman as the family\\'s primary wage-earner. Trump wrote that his \"big mistake\" with his first wife, Ivana, was \"taking her out of the role of wife and allowing her to run one of my casinos in Atlantic City, then the Plaza hotel.\" She did an excellent job at both, he wrote, but once she took on those roles \"work was all she wanted to talk about.\" \"I will never again give a wife responsibility within my business,\" Trump wrote. \"Ivana worked very hard, and I appreciate the effort, but I soon began to realize that I was married to a business person rather than a wife.\" On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump has said his wife, Melania, would make a great first lady. Melania Trump, a former model who has designed her own jewelry line for QVC, has emerged as an important advocate for her husband, driving the argument that he treats everyone equally. She has spoken about the importance of her career, but described herself in an interview with Parenting Magazine as a \"full-time mom\" to her son Barron. \"That is my first job.\" Melania has tried to explain the paradox of Trump and women by saying that when her husband is attacked, \"He will attack back, no matter who you are.\" \"He encourages everybody, if you\\'re a man or a woman,\" she said during an April 12 Trump family CNN town hall. His daughter Ivanka, a successful businesswoman in her own right, said during the CNN town hall that he taught her that there \"wasn\\'t anything that I couldn\\'t do if I set my mind to it.\" She also praised him for hiring \"incredible female role models\" in \"the highest executive positions at the Trump organization.\" But Trump has repeatedly stumbled into controversy with his asides about women over the past year, and his approval numbers among women have spiraled downward. The Republican Party was already facing a deficit among women voters. In 2012, Barack Obama led Mitt Romney among female voters by about 11 points -- with a particularly steep deficit among single women. (Romney beat Obama by 7 points among married women, who have generally viewed the GOP more favorably). In a March Quinnipiac University poll, 60% of women said they would not vote for Trump in a general election -- a reflection of his poor approval ratings among women in a wide variety of national polls. His campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, predicted Trump\\'s image among women would improve as the campaign progressed. His aides have pointed out that he trounced his rivals among Republican women in recent GOP primaries, including Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut (though that is hardly a good measure of how he would fare in a general election). \"Donald Trump\\'s numbers are going to be strong with women because they want the same thing that everybody else wants,\" Lewandowski said in a telephone interview. \"They don\\'t vote based on gender. They vote on competency -- and that competency includes making sure that the nation is secure, which Donald Trump has pledged he will do, making sure we don\\'t have illegal immigrants pouring across the border, and making sure individuals have opportunities for jobs. \"Those are the things that cut across socio-economic status, they cut across gender, they cut across race.\" Beyond focusing on those broad themes, however, Trump has done little to try to shore up his weaknesses among women voters. His various stumbles haven\\'t helped. He angered both abortion-rights supporters and opponents, for example, when he said during an MSNBC town hall that women who have abortions should be punished if the procedure is outlawed—and then quickly reversed himself. His personal critiques of women\\'s looks on the campaign trail have been pointed. When an anti-Trump super PAC cut an ad that used a revealing photo of Melania from her days as a super model, Trump blamed Cruz. \"Be Careful, Lyin\\' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife,\" he tweeted. He offended some female voters when he re-tweeted an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz, a Goldman Sachs executive, next to Melania. \"A picture is worth a thousand words,\" the caption said. Angered by the tweets, Cruz warned his then-adversary to \"leave Heidi the hell alone,\" and told reporters: \"Strong women scare Donald.\" Trump insisted the press stirred up the controversy. \"The media is so after me on women,\" the real estate magnate tweeted on March 26. \"Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump.\" But female voters seem increasingly skeptical as Trump prepares to take on Hillary Clinton, who is running to be the first female president. Some women who have worked for Trump say they find it difficult to reconcile some of his statements and written opinions with the way he treated them. Jill Cremer worked as a vice president overseeing real estate development at the Trump Organization for a decade beginning in 1998. She said it was a hard decision to leave, and she only learned after working elsewhere just how good she\\'d had it. \"He was a fantastic employer,\" said Cremer, still a real-estate executive in Manhattan. \"I don\\'t have one bad thing to say about him.\" She said Trump ran the office as a meritocracy and was refreshingly unconcerned about educational pedigrees. Though she went to work for Trump at the relatively young age of 30, she said he put her on projects that challenged her and forced her to grow. \"He\\'d say, \\'I believe in you. I\\'m gonna give you this -- now go run with it,\" Cremer recalled. \"And I did it,\" she said. Cremer said Trump has made some cringe-worthy public comments involving women over the years, but she said he never talked that way to her or in her presence. \"I don\\'t know how to explain it,\" she said. \"But, when you\\'re on the inside, it\\'s different.\" Lili Amini, who manages Trump\\'s golf club in Palos Verdes, offered a similar description of her billionaire boss. Amini, who was identified by a Trump campaign aide as a female employee who could talk about his management style, said she met Trump in 2005 when she accompanied her father to work at the sprawling resort overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Her parents owned a flower business and maintained the plants and flowers at the Trump facility. She was 27 at the time and studying to be a buyer in the fashion world. She said Trump walked up and asked her father: \"Who\\'s this?\" He introduced his daughter and the two struck up a conversation. By the end of it, Amini recalled, Trump told her: \"I want you to work here.\" She said she didn\\'t know anything about running a food and beverage operation at the time, and didn\\'t even know what job she was being offered. But after discussing the offer with her parents she decided it was too good to pass up. She started out as the small events coordinator and, with Trump\\'s mentoring and support, has worked her way to general manager. She said Trump would periodically show up at the resort and each time he did would encourage her to learn everything she could about some new aspect of the business. He was always encouraging, she said, and always professional. He taught her, she said, to never doubt herself. \"He\\'s been a great motivator,\" she said. \"Impossible is never a word that I use in my vocabulary.\" Amini said Trump never made her feel like she got the job because she was a woman or that she was being second-guessed based on her gender after she rose through the ranks. \"It\\'s just about the work,\" she said. \"It\\'s always about the work.\" Trump received more mixed reviews from Barbara Res, who worked for Trump from 1978 to 1996 and helped oversee the construction of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. Res said she had good working relationship with Trump and that it was an unusual move for him to hire her in 1978, because there were so few women working in the construction industry. But Res, who wrote about her experiences in her book, All Alone on the 68th Floor: How One Woman Changed the Face of Construction, said Trump became less approachable and accessible over time. In an essay for the New York Daily News, Res wrote that Trump was \"nasty to the people who work for him,\" that he could \"be very abusive and curt\" and had an \"incredible temper ... he lashes out at everyone.\" \"Of all the people I know who worked for or with Trump, including contractors, lawyers, architects, employees, only a very few actually like him,\" Res wrote in the New York Daily News. \"Some respect him, some don\\'t. Many hate his guts.\" But she said he had a good eye for talent, and had several strong women working for him in her heyday. He told her she was \"a killer\" and that wanting to be liked by her subordinates was a weakness. \"Later, he would hire and promote many people with questionable qualifications,\" Res wrote in her New York Daily News essay. \"I could see, over time, his growing need to be coddled and agreed with,\" she wrote, adding that by the 1980s, he \"had taken to decorating his office with beautiful women.\" \"He changed,\" Res said in a telephone interview. \"I think it was fame and fortune, absolutely.\" In his book, Trump wrote: \"I don\\'t know why, but I seem to bring out either the best or worst in women.\" He reiterated that \"they\\'re really a lot different than portrayed,\" and \"far worse than men, far more aggressive.\" He praised their intelligence and said they should be saluted for their \"tremendous power, which most men are afraid to admit they have.\"', 'Email  In 2013, Americans learned that AT&T had been providing data about countless telephone calls to federal drug agents without proper search warrants as part of a secret program called Project Hemisphere . Now it emerges that the telecommunications giant is not just eagerly cooperating with the government but also turning a hefty profit — at taxpayer expense — in the process.  The New York Times broke the 2013 story about Hemisphere based on a PowerPoint presentation obtained from West Coast police agencies by a Washington state peace activist. The paper described the program as \"a partnership between federal and local drug officials and AT&T\" whereby \"the government pays AT&T to place its employees in drug-fighting units around the country,\" where they \"supply [agents] with the phone data from as far back as 1987\" on the basis of a subpoena issued by the agency, not a search warrant approved by a judge.  \"The scale and longevity of the data storage appears to be unmatched by other government programs, including the N.S.A.\\'s gathering of phone call logs under the Patriot Act,\" the Times wrote, noting that \"Hemisphere covers every call that passes through an AT&T switch\" and \"includes information on the locations of callers.\"  As bad as that makes Hemisphere sound, the reality is much worse. The Daily Beast \\'s Kenneth Lipp reported Tuesday: Hemisphere isn\\'t a \"partnership\" but rather a product AT&T developed, marketed, and sold at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers. No warrant is required to make use of the company\\'s massive trove of data, according to AT&T documents, only a promise from law enforcement to not disclose Hemisphere if an investigation using it becomes public.  AT&T, which owns more than three-quarters of U.S. landline switches and is second only to Verizon when it comes to wireless infrastructure and cellphone towers, \"stores details for every call, text message, Skype chat, or other communication that has passed through its infrastructure,\" wrote Lipp, adding that this comes to \"trillions of records.\" What\\'s more, the company retains those records much longer than other carriers.  \"The database,\" penned Lipp, \"allows its analysts to detect hidden patterns and connections between call detail records, and make highly accurate inferences about the associations and movements of the people Hemisphere is used to surveil.\"  Not surprisingly, government agencies love having access to this vast treasure trove of data, especially since they can obtain it without a warrant. Thus, even though Hemisphere may initially have been created to fight the unconstitutional war on drugs, its use quickly expanded to other types of investigations, including Medicaid fraud and homicide.  How much does the program cost taxpayers? According to Lipp, \"Sheriff and police departments pay from $100,000 to upward of $1 million a year or more for Hemisphere access.\" And since they love having access to this kind of data, they\\'ll keep shelling out more for it every year, particularly since Washington is picking up the tab. Harris County, Texas, started out paying the relatively modest sum of $77,924 in 2007; four years later, its annual tab had shot up to $940,000.  \"Did you see that movie Field of Dreams ?\" American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) technology policy analyst Christopher Soghoian asked Lipp. \"It\\'s like that line, \\'if you build it, they will come.\\' Once a company creates a huge surveillance apparatus like this and provides it to law enforcement, they then have to provide it whenever the government asks. They\\'ve developed this massive program and of course they\\'re going to sell it to as many people as possible.\"  Besides matters of cost, there are \"serious Fourth Amendment concerns\" and \"profound privacy concerns\" with Hemisphere, ACLU deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer told the Times in 2013. That explains why the program is kept so hush-hush. The slides obtained by that newspaper told law enforcement \"to never refer to Hemisphere in any official document.\" An AT&T statement of work obtained by the Daily Beast says, \"The Government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence.\"  \"I\\'d speculate that one reason for the secrecy of the program is that it would be very hard to justify it to the public or the courts,\" Jaffer told the Times .  That\\'s why investigators who obtain leads from Hemisphere often turn around and use more legal and constitutional means to obtain the same evidence, a practice known as \"parallel construction.\" By doing so, they can introduce the evidence in court without revealing where they first obtained it.  \"At a minimum there is a very serious question whether they should be doing it [searching Hemisphere] without a warrant,\" Electronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney Adam Schwartz told Lipp. \"A benefit to the parallel construction is they never have to face that crucible. Then the judge, the defendant, the general public, the media, and elected officials never know that AT&T and police across America funded by the White House are using the world\\'s largest metadata database to surveil people.\"  AT&T claims that it is merely complying with lawful requests for data, not doing anything special. Soghoian begs to differ, telling Lipp, \"They say they only cooperate with law enforcement as required, and frankly, that\\'s offensive when they are mining the data of millions of innocent people, and really built a business and services around the needs of law enforcement.\"  Some are wondering if these revelations will have any effect on AT&T\\'s attempt to merge with Time Warner, which has yet to be approved by federal regulators. Reason \\'s Scott Shackford thinks that, if anything, the fact that AT&T has been so helpful will only play in its favor. \"AT&T is essentially the company the federal government made it become,\" he wrote, recalling what happened to telecom companies like Qwest that didn\\'t play ball with Uncle Sam. \"Imagine them trying to get permission for this merger with Time Warner if they hadn\\'t been so cooperative with the federal government with surveillance.\"  Americans who are concerned about their privacy should keep that in mind. Outrage at AT&T is certainly warranted, but the brunt of their anger should be directed at the politicians and bureaucrats who have created a government with the power to compel — or at least strongly encourage — businesses to collaborate in the destruction of our God-given liberties.', 'A presidential election scheduled for Thursday will take place as the Supreme Court was unable to hear a petition to delay it, said a lawyer for the election commission on Wednesday. It means elections are on tomorrow. There is no order stopping the election, lawyer Paul Muite told Kenyan television station Citizen TV.', 'The U.S. Congress should consider overhauling its system of benefits for disabled people in Puerto Rico, who get almost no government help, according to a new report by a task force addressing the island\\'s economic crisis. The report, released Tuesday, cited a December 9 Reuters investigation that detailed the scant support for island residents with severe mental and physical problems. Most get nothing. Those who do get benefits receive an average of $74 a month - about a tenth of what the U.S. gives the disabled in its 50 states. Reuters also revealed wide disparities in support among U.S. territories. Read the Special Report here: reut.rs/2hg0vDR Sen. Orrin Hatch - a Republican from Utah who heads the bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico - did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. The task force recommended that Congress consider providing Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories the same Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits it grants to the states. Four of five U.S. territories - Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands - have been excluded from SSI since the program launched in the 1970s. The fifth territory, the Northern Mariana Islands, gets the same SSI benefits as a state, with an average payment of $560 monthly, in part because it negotiated its territory status at about the same time Congress enacted the SSI program. Disabled Puerto Ricans, by contrast, receive much less through a nearly forgotten program administered by the Administration of Children and Families (ACF), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Nearly half of Puerto Rico\\'s disabled residents live in poverty - twice the rate of those in the 50 states. The disabled in Guam receive an average of $164, and in the Virgin Islands, $176. Disabled people in American Samoa get nothing. SSI offers disabled residents of U.S. states up to $733 each month and pays an average of $540. As an alternative to giving the territories SSI benefits, the task force suggested Congress could increase benefits through ACF. Federal funding for the program has been capped since 1996 and is not indexed for inflation. The panel also recommended that ACF publicly release up-to-date information about the benefits paid to disabled citizens of U.S. territories. When Reuters first requested comment on benefits for the disabled in Puerto Rico, ACF declined to make anyone available because \"no one is completely versed in all the details,\" said spokesman Pat Fisher. On Wednesday, Fisher declined to comment on the task force recommendations. \"We cannot offer an opinion on proposed policy,\" he said. \"We only carry out approved policy.\" A 2014 study by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found that if Puerto Rico received SSI, eligibility would expand ten-fold from nearly 34,500 in 2011 to 354,000 people. The federal government\\'s payments to the island would skyrocket from $24 million to as much as $1.8 billion annually. The task force also made recommendations about how to improve health care in Puerto Rico, which the group described as \"a serious and urgent issue.\" For decades, the U.S. offered lower payments to Puerto Rico under the federally sponsored Medicare and Medicaid insurance programs, which cover most people on the island. The Medicaid insurance program for the poor, for example, has had its funding capped by Washington for decades, spurring island officials to borrow heavily through municipal bonds. That contributed to what is now the largest municipal debt crisis in U.S. history. An estimated one-third of Puerto Rico\\'s $70 billion of outstanding debt stems from bonds issued to shore up healthcare funding. Reuters reported in October that Puerto Rico\\'s physicians are fleeing the island\\'s financially strapped healthcare system for high-paying and more stable jobs in the 50 states. The resulting shortage of doctors has exacerbated waits for appointments on the island to longer than 18 months in some specialties. Read the Special Report here: reut.rs/2e4T00o The most-cited reason for giving Puerto Rico unequal treatment in Medicaid and other programs is because Puerto Ricans do not pay federal income taxes. Some members of the task force believe that may warrant lower allocations for social welfare on the island, according to the report. Other members disagreed. All members, however, agreed \"more equitable treatment should still be considered,\" according to the report. That would reduce the incentive for Puerto Rico residents to migrate to U.S. states, as they have in large numbers for decades, leaving behind a more vulnerable population. The panel urged Congress to begin addressing the funding issues early next year, and suggested federal funding of the island\\'s Medicaid program be \"more closely tied to the size and needs of the territory\\'s low-income population.\"', 'Tweet Widget by Yohannes Woldemariam  The minority ethnic regime in Ethiopia now faces multiple rebellions. The regime\\'s foreign friends are part of the problem. \"Faced with increased intrusion into their lands by so-called international investors, by displacement and by the breakdown of their social fabric, Ethiopians are mobilizing to resist.\" The once formidable government coalition \"is beginning to unravel.\" The Deteriorating Situation in Ethiopia by Yohannes Woldemariam  This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News .  \" The revolts are widespread and they appear beyond the power of the state to control and put down.\"  The revolts in Ethiopia have the potential for creating radical, beneficial changes in the political order or instigating complete chaos that crosses its borders and destabilizes the entire fragile Horn of Africa region, for the outcomes of such uprisings have varied considerably from country to country. These protests can be the catalyst for building a new and democratic Ethiopia or end up in tears and disillusionment, as in Libya, South Sudan and many other places in the world. Countries emerging from dictatorships are particularly vulnerable and Ethiopia is certainly under a vicious dictatorship.  The events in Ethiopia are being described as \"Intifada,\" \"Ethiopian Spring\" or as something akin to the Color Revolutions in the Ukraine and Georgia and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China. During the uprising in 2005 protesting the rigged election, the late chief of the Tigrean Peoples\\' Liberation Front (TPLF) and Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, did say that there would not be any more Color Revolutions in Ethiopia. That uprising was put down with hundreds dead and thousands in concentration camps.  This time, however, the revolts are widespread and they appear beyond the power of the state to control and put down. Apparently, Mr. Zenawi spoke prematurely. Technological innovation is a very important part of this current political mass mobilization, which is why the government has moved with cutting Ethiopia off from the internet and dismantling satellite dishes from the homes of ordinary citizens. Drawing on satellite television, mobile phones and the Internet, the revolts are spreading. Within seconds, activists send their messages against the tyranny. Unsurprisingly, the TPLF oligarchy is extremely fearful of social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and the diaspora media.  In this piece, I want to reflect on three points:  1. The celebrity factor: Feyisa Lilesa versus Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn  2. Mr. Abay Tsehaye\\'s reference to Rwanda  3. The newly declared State of Emergency  The celebrity factor: Feyisa Lilesa versus Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn  In the wake of the Rio Olympics, the profile of the Ethiopian uprising got a boost from Feyisa Lilesa , with his heroic act of crossing his arms on winning the silver medal for marathon, a signature symbol of solidarity of the oppressed Oromo nation to which Feyisa belongs. The influence of the celebrity athlete for social change is formidable, and Feyisa has emerged as a powerful voice for the struggle of his Oromo people, causing nervous shivers in the beleaguered regime. What the death and imprisonment of thousands of Oromos couldn\\'t accomplish in Ethiopia was achieved by his symbolic act at the finish line. Now the whole world is clued into the terrible conditions in Ethiopia and beginning to learn about the plight of the Oromo people.  Other Ethiopian athletes have since used their successes to follow suit. Ebsa Ejigu, Tamiru Demissie and Hirut Guangul have used their international successes to publicize the plight of their country\\'s men and women to an international audience. This trend is likely to continue now as other athletes and celebrities are losing their fear of retaliation and becoming more and more willing to participate in what has become a growing national movement. Yes, these athletes will pay a price. Lilesa is now separated from his wife and children and beckoning an unknown fate. Life in exile will not be easy even for famous athletes. But compared to those losing lives and limbs to bullets in Ethiopia, it is a small price to pay. They are heroes, and their names are already inscribed in history books.  \"These athletes will pay a price.\"  The TPLF reaction to Lilesa\\'s heroic act can be gleaned from statements given by PM Hailemariam Desalegn. Although the PM is from the Wolayta ethnic group, which was traditionally relegated to the periphery of the Ethiopian mainstream, he has become a willing accomplice and spokesman for the TPLF. Most people regard him as an accidental PM who happened to be in the right place and at the right time when his powerful boss, PM Meles Zenawi, passed away in the summer of 2012. He was handpicked as Zenawi\\'s deputy because he wasn\\'t a threat and, as a non-Tigrean, served as a convenient cover and a token representing \"diversity\" for the TPLF. He is so loyal to the late PM, he still refers to the Meles \"vision\" in his public pronouncements. Most Ethiopians know that he is just a figurehead with no real power. Yet, in an interview conducted with the online Foreign Policy.com, he is quoted as saying:  \"It\\'s me who sent [Lilesa] to Rio for the Olympics, and we expected him to come back after winning the medal. . . . [T]his is not the capacity of the man himself. It\\'s something which has been orchestrated by someone else from outside.\"  It is remarkable that the PM has the audacity to say he sent Feyisa Lilesa to the Olympics, as if Feyisa needed his charitable permission. It is crystal clear that Feyisa earned his place in the Olympics.  One can readily concede that he may have acquiesced to nepotism by sending to the Olympics the unqualified son of the head of the sports federation, Robel Kiros Habte , who made Ethiopia a laughing stock with his hopeless performance in a swimming race. But no one can doubt that Feyisa went to the Olympics because he was Ethiopia\\'s best hope for the marathon. And he delivered in no unmistakable terms by winning a silver medal competing with the best and the elites in the world. It is hard to believe that Desalegn referring to Feyisa actually said: \"This is not the capacity of the man himself\" – thus exposing his own pomposity, shallowness and contempt for the Oromo hero. Clearly, Desalegn has sold his soul to the TPLF devil. To suggest that Feyisa cannot think for himself and act on his own is inexcusably ignorant and arrogant and unbecoming of a prime minster.  \"Desalegn is a sellout with little dignity, reading and parroting whatever script is given to him by the TPLF.\"  Feyisa is not only a fine athlete; he is also a dignified, proud, principled and articulate Oromo and Ethiopian, as he amply demonstrated during the press conference in the Washington D.C. rally where Congressman Chris Smith also spoke. Also, in a direct reply to the PM\\'s insult, Feyisa quipped:  \"I was not surprised by his comments because individuals who are always controlled by others tend to assume everyone is that way as well. . . . Unlike the prime minister, I make my own decisions and speak for myself.\"  Indeed, Desalegn is a sellout with little dignity, reading and parroting whatever script is given to him by the TPLF. The pretentious PM has replaced the real world with a make-believe virtual world. It is for this reason that he is unable to see realities on the ground; he is temporarily sheltered behind a wall whose mortar is sychophantic servitude and a wicked willingness to say and do anything to appease his TPLF benefactors.  It is beyond regrettable that Desalegn is unable to see the rapid downside toward further chaos and civil war in Ethiopia that is due to the abject misery and oppression suffered by the people who are subjected to the policies of those he is serving and to whom he has sold his soul. He calls himself a born-again Christian with a straight face. How would Jesus himself, who stood up to the hypocritical Pharisees and threw the money-changers out of the temple in Jerusalem, have regarded a man like Desalegn, who is in bed with the TPLF elites who are the modern day equivalent of the Pharisees in Ethiopia and whose words and actions rarely match? The human suffering that is the result of the violent and continuous repression cannot be seen from inside their ideological castles resting on the thin air of empty rhetoric and shameless self-promotion.  Desalegn would be well advised to keep his mouth closed to spare himself more disgrace. He has already sunk into the deep end of an abyss. It is depressing to see a human being selling out his people and becoming a slave of oppressors.  Invoking the specter of Rwanda  The TPLF ideologue and one of the real powers behind the throne, Mr. Abay Tsehaye, in an interview with the pro-government Radio Fana, compared the situation of Rwanda in the early 90s to the current situation in Ethiopia. He correctly stated that Rwanda was comprised of only two ethnic groups (the Hutu and the Tutsi), really not much of a country, and was on the verge of disintegration. He went on to say that reconciliation occurred and the country recovered. In Ethiopia with over eighty ethnic groups, if the situation goes \"out of control,\" he concluded, Ethiopia will cease to exist as a country. Every thoughtful person worries about this. However, one can reasonably surmise from his analysis that Ethiopia under the control of his Tigray-dominated government, who make up only six percent of the Ethiopian population, is his guarantee for holding the country together. Mr. Tsehaye fails to recognize the draconian hegemonic policies of his regime as the very reasons for the grim state of affairs in the country. As the Ethiopian uprising makes clear, the various ethnicities are no longer buying TPLF shenanigans and see the TPLF itself as the main cause of Ethiopia\\'s predicament, as the country descends into possible civil war.  For anyone willing to see the truth, Ethiopia is in a state of turmoil due to the exploitation of the long-suffering people of Oromia, Ogaden, Gambella and other ethnic groups by the TPLF elite in partnership with international enablers such as China and the United States, the principal rivals in Africa and the Horn region. The TPLF exploitation, in which valuable resources and political roles are dominated by a minority elite that has transformed itself into an oligarchy, has created highly rebellious resentment by the victims while reinforcing a sense of ethnic identity and consciousness. Faced with increased intrusion into their lands by so-called international investors, by the displacement and stunted developments they experience and by the breakdown of their social fabric, Ethiopians are mobilizing to resist.  \"The various see the TPLF itself as the main cause of Ethiopia\\'s predicament, as the country descends into possible civil war.\"  The government\\'s state-driven development projects financed by international investors and partners bypass the rural peasants and pastoralists, alienating the people and reinforcing the politics of deep ethnic hierarchy. Recent events have made it clear that TPLF\\'s \"constitutional federalism\" has more to do with its divide-and-rule strategy and its elitist allocation of national resources, comparable to actions of the former Soviet Communist Party, which retained tight control over its regions through local parties. The TPLF set up People\\'s Democratic Organizations, local versions of the ruling party, which squeezed out traditional authority.  The co-opted ethnic leaders from these regions have either completely lost credibility, are sitting on the fence, or are jumping ship to support the resistance. Key former government figures like Junedin Sado are breaking their silence and speaking out with scathing attacks on the regime. He has apologized to the Ethiopian people for the time that he served under the regime. The so- called coalition that the TPLF built is beginning to unravel. Some Amhara and some Oromo are coming together against the TPLF, overcoming but not necessarily forgetting, the legacy of the historic oppression by Amhara elites which began with Menelik II.  Abay Tsehaye and TPLF leaders will need to face reality — if they have it in them to be truly concerned about Ethiopian unity. Oromo historical grievances are not myths, as some revisionist history asserts. Oromo land is the most fertile and lush in Ethiopia, in contrast to the northern Ethiopian highlands with its rugged mountains and thin soils contributing relatively little to national economic production, but the Oromo have been alienated from control over their land throughout the 20th century first by the Amhara and now by the new TPLF overlords.  Acutely divided societies in which no single faction can impose its view might find an ability to arrive at political compromises in a constitutional form. But in Ethiopia, the hegemonic Amhara and now the Tigreans have excluded others from real power-sharing making true constitutionalism elusive. The leaders see the state as a prize to be won, a basis for private accumulation and patronage. But there is not enough patronage to go around, and those excluded from it mobilize their co-religionists and ethnic groups in an increasingly unmanageable opposition.  The State of Emergency  In response, the TPLF is relying on intensified repression by security forces, ethnic loyalists and the army. And for the first time in twenty-five years, the regime has declared a State of Emergency , clearly showing how rattled it is by the rebellion in the country. The Prime Minster announced :  \"The cause of this (state of emergency) is that anti-peace forces in collaboration with foreign enemies of the country are making organized attempts to destabilize our country, to disrupt its peace and also to undermine the existence and security of its peoples.\"  This response undoubtedly means more sticks and further erosion of civil liberties in the country but is unlikely to quell the unrest. One of the targets of the State of Emergency is the Internet and Social Media. PM Desalegn did make it a point to rant against diaspora media and the Internet during his appearance in September at the United Nations General Assembly:  \"In fact, we are seeing how misinformation could easily go viral via social media and mislead many people, especially the youth…Social media has certainly empowered populists and other extremists to exploit people\\'s genuine concerns and spread their message of hate and bigotry without any inhibition...it is critical to underline one matter which is usually given short shrift, both by the media and others. It is simply hypocritical to deny that some of our countries have been targets for destabilization activities carried out with no accountability by people and groups who have been given shelters by States with whom we have absolutely no problems.\"  The regime that Desalegn serves is responsible for suffocating the Ethiopian people by denying them any alternative media. The Ethiopian government is one of the top jailers and harassers of anyone daring to publish or practice independent journalism within the country. Now, Desalegn is shedding his crocodile tears about his inability to control and suppress social media and broadcasting emanating from the diaspora. While he has a point about the inherent potential for the abuse of social media, the regime is responsible for bringing criticisms on itself. In the absence of media freedom in the country, social media and broadcasting from the diaspora acquired enormous significance for Ethiopians hungry for information. It is clear that Ethiopians no longer trust the regime and have little confidence in official government news, which in reality is mostly propaganda.  \"The Ethiopian government is one of the top jailers and harassers of anyone daring to publish or practice independent journalism.\"  Authoritarian regimes adopt various forms of censorship to depoliticize the population and prevent the questioning of their legitimacy. By definition, authoritarian regimes demand strict submission by the media to their political authority. They do so by publishing or broadcasting deceptions in order to maintain their power structures. For example, the regime\\'s media censored Feyisa\\'s symbolic gesture in Rio while proclaiming that Feyisa is a national hero and welcome to return home, without any consequences.  The advent of the Internet has somewhat leveled the playing field by empowering regular Internet users to become content producers by utilizing decentralized and distributed networks such as social media. These uses of media pose a great danger to dictatorial regimes, which are moving to subvert, block social media and limit internet use, as in Ethiopia today.  China is the leading culprit in creating the technology to enable censorship, which it is sharing with the Ethiopian government. This suppression of the media will not succeed. Freedom-loving people find ways to circumvent these barriers and make determined efforts to stay informed – and, in turn, to inform the whole world. Yohannes Woldemariam is an educator and author.

[2]', 'Members of the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives will discuss next week whether the nation\\'s top tax collector, John Koskinen, should be impeached over conservative charges he stonewalled a congressional investigation, House leaders said Wednesday. Democrats decried the move as a politically motivated embarrassment that would in any case be stopped in the Senate. Even some Republicans said they did not think Koskinen\\'s activities justified impeachment from his post as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commissioner. Conservative Republicans in the House have said Koskinen failed to comply with a congressional investigation into whether the IRS applied extra scrutiny to applications for tax exempt status by conservative groups between 2010 and 2012. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other leading House Republicans have shown little interest in pursuing impeachment. But Ryan indicated Wednesday that he expected floor action because conservatives had filed a privileged resolution, which can bypass regular procedures and take precedence on the House floor. \"This is something that we\\'re going to have a planning conference on next week,\" Ryan told a regular press conference. \"This is something where Congress is going to work its will.\" The Senate\\'s Democratic leader, Harry Reid, called the process a \"waste, put that in big capital letters\" and said it could be blocked in the Senate by that chamber\\'s Majority Leader, Republican Mitch McConnell. A spokesman for McConnell declined to say what action McConnell might take if the House does vote for Koskinen\\'s impeachment. \"I know Koskinen very well,\" another senior Senate Republican, Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch told Reuters. \"Yeah, he\\'s made mistakes but he hasn\\'t made mistakes that justify an impeachment.\" Koskinen became IRS commissioner in December 2013, after the controversy already had exploded over the way the agency had handled the applications for tax exempt status. Members of the House Freedom Caucus, the chamber\\'s most conservative bloc, have said Koskinen should be pushed out because of his role in the aftermath of the scandal. They noted that he was commissioner when backup tapes were destroyed containing emails from former IRS official Lois Lerner, who had headed the IRS\\' tax-exempt division. Democrats have noted that the Justice Department brought no criminal charges against Lerner and say the case against Koskinen shows little more than agency mismanagement and misstatements.', 'The Senate voted 51-48 this afternoon to proceed to the resolution, S.

Our newest fighter jets can\\'t even fly in the rain,\" Thiel said on the final evening of the four-day convention in Cleveland. \"Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East.\" A co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook Inc who sits on that company\\'s board of directors, Thiel is well-known for contrarian and even eccentric views: a Libertarian who supports gay rights and legalizing marijuana, and who has proposed floating cities beyond the government\\'s reach while encouraging students to drop out of college and start companies. His support of Trump has been both a source of curiosity and the butt of jokes in Silicon Valley, where Trump\\'s anti-immigrant, anti-trade positions are regarded with horror. Many tech executives lean Democratic, and prominent Republican tech executives such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman have also rejected Trump. Thiel, who is gay, was expected to address gay rights in front of a political party whose platform rejects gay marriage and gay rights in general. He stopped short of such an appeal, however, addressing his sexuality only when saying: \"I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American.\" He is only the second openly gay man to address the Republican National Convention, CNN reported. \"When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union, and we won,\" Thiel said. \"Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?\" Thiel said his support for Trump was based on the belief that the candidate could address the country\\'s economic decline. He cited the space program and other government technology achievements as examples of what has been lost. Thiel drew parallels between himself and Trump each as a \"builder.\" His family emigrated from Germany when Thiel was one year old, and arrived in Cleveland - the city hosting this week\\'s convention. When Thiel pointed that out, he got loud applause. Back then, Thiel said, \"Opportunity was everywhere.\" \"In 1968, the world\\'s high-tech capital wasn\\'t just one city.

That\\'s what\\'s been happening nearly every weekend since the beginning of the year, with Republican groups, influencers and politicians each hoping to attract top-tier candidates to their event. With national Republicans trying to limit debates this year, the multifaceted events have become the new normal for both candidates and the media. On Saturday, both announced and likely GOP candidates will head to Iowa for the next one, where freshman GOP Sen. Joni Ernst will hold her inaugural \"Roast and Ride.\" So far, there have been at least a dozen different cattle calls since January. And if it feels like there\\'s been a lot of cattle calls this year, maybe that\\'s because there\\'s a lot of cattle. For lesser-known candidates in such a crowded field, the different events offer a chance to try to and catch fire with often little investment or infrastructure needed. \"You have a megaphone from the inside out,\" said longtime Iowa GOP strategist Tim Albrecht. \"There\\'s no other place these candidates can go where they will see 200 media confined to one location. That\\'s potentially 200 stories they wouldn\\'t have otherwise gotten. With these kinds of events, it\\'s a very low bar to participate and to even be invited.\" And in Iowa – a state where GOP voters insist on meeting their candidates early and often – the guaranteed national attention has also been a boon for state and local Republicans. \"Everybody is a beneficiary of these events, whether it\\'s the local county party, the state party the campaigns and the voters,\" Albrecht said, \"because this gives Iowans the opportunity to see these candidates and potential candidates on the same stage, back to back, to directly compare how each of them would handle a particular situation. These are a wonderful way for Iowans to gauge candidates on an Iowa stage who eventually want be on the world stage.\" To national observers, the cattle calls have become the new debates and a way for hopefuls, who haven\\'t been getting as much attention, to boost their profile, so they can ultimately make it onto the debate stage later this year. \"A lot of the folks in the field not named [former Florida Gov.] Jeb Bush, [Wisconsin Gov.] Scott Walker, or [Florida Sen.] Marco Rubio, they don\\'t have very high name ID,\" national GOP strategist Ford O\\'Connell said. \"That\\'s why the cattle calls are taking on an added importance in the way we haven\\'t seen before.\" The field will naturally be winnowed down after the first few states vote early next year. But until then, if candidates aren\\'t able to get momentum before the debates, \"donors aren\\'t going to open up their wallets,\" O\\'Connell said. The burst of early events in 2015 helped some candidates jump to the head of the pack nationally. Albrecht pointed to Walker\\'s breakout performance at the Iowa Freedom Summit this past January as one example. While he noted that Iowans had been wowed by his speeches already the previous year, the first major cattle call gave the Wisconsin governor the momentum he needed. \"There was serious buzz after that event,\" said Albrecht, a former top aide to Gov. Terry Branstad, R-Iowa. \"Scott Walker has real star power.\" He also pointed to former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina — who performed well at last month\\'s Iowa Lincoln Day Dinner and had a big crowd outside her room — and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry — who needs a comeback after not living up to the hype in the state four years ago — as candidates who have shone at the events. Both will be at Ernst\\'s event this weekend — only Perry and Walker will be riding motorcycles along the GOP senator, though. Seven candidates will be in attendance, including Rubio, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Fiorina and Perry have yet to see much evidence of what activists say have been good performances. Both are still mired in single digits in both early state polls and national surveys, the latter of which will determine whether they make it onto the debate state during the first faceoff in August. That makes their continued performance in such cattle calls all the more important along with building their political operations. \"Everything\\'s been turned on its head, because of the capping of the debates and the calendar,\" O\\'Connell warned. \"You know if you\\'re not on the first one or two debate stages, it\\'s going to be hard to get past New Hampshire.\"', 'An unidentified photographer is reported to have fallen backwards off a press riser at Donald Trump s rally in Bethpage, New York.About 8,000 people were reported to be in attendance at the rally, which was held at Grumman Studios.

He often targets the media during his rants, inciting his followers to turn on the press. At other rallies, he s called the media dishonest and scum. He has also forced reporters to remain inside fenced-off pens. At a December 21 rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump told his audience I would never kill [journalists] but I do hate them. His hatred vehement hatred toward the press is not just ugly and wrong, it s dangerous to every reporter, journalist and photographer in America. The idea that Trump is creating a nationwide mob of potentially violent, media-hating followers is chilling.In August of last year, Allison Parker, a reporter with Virginia s WDBJ-TV was shot and killed on live TV. The man who shot her was a former coworker who had mental health issues. We can only guess how many of Trump s followers have similar mental health issues.Judging by the reaction of the crowd when the reporter fell from the risers, I d say a lot.Credit: Andrew Renneisen / Stringer Getty Images News', 'One of the \"few regrets\" of his presidency, President Obama said dolefully in his State of the Union speech, was \"that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.\" Were he endowed with \"the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt,\" he remarked, he could have done more to bridge the partisan divide. But he pledged to \"keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.\" Did you experience a touch of déjà vu when the president said that? Four years ago, when he was in the home stretch of his first term and running for a second, he said much the same thing. \"I\\'m the first one to confess that the spirit that I brought to Washington, that I wanted to see instituted, where we weren\\'t constantly in a political slugfest . . . I haven\\'t fully accomplished that,\" Obama told an interviewer in 2012. \"My biggest disappointment is that we haven\\'t changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked.\" Did he even try? From his earliest days as a presidential contender, Obama had held himself out as a healer — as a visionary who would never \"pit red America against blue America,\" who committed himself to ending \"a politics that breeds division and conflict and cynicism.\" That uplifting promise was at the very heart of Obama\\'s appeal; it was what led so many voters to invest so much hope and faith — even love — in the prospect of an Obama presidency. Yet in his first term, American political life grew more bitter, not less. Unity and goodwill receded even further. As measured by Gallup, Obama supplanted George W. Bush as the most polarizing president ever. Democrats and Republicans blamed each other for the nastiness and distrust. The president often took the low road; his opponents often did too. Deeply controversial legislation, especially Obamacare, was rammed through on party-line votes. The rise of the Tea Party prefigured sweeping Republican gains in the 2010 midterm elections, which led both parties into an even more toxic relationship. By the time Obama ran for reelection in 2012, little remained of 2008\\'s optimistic candidate of hope. In his place was a snappish incumbent grimly focused on winning a second term by any means necessary. Even liberal media outlets remarked on the disparity. \"Obama and his top campaign aides have engaged far more frequently in character attacks and personal insults,\" Politico reported. But when voters renewed Obama\\'s lease on the White House, they also gave him a fresh opportunity to make good on the signal promise of his rise to power. A second term offered this most polarizing of presidents a chance to extend olive branches — and to eschew the ad hominem attacks that so infuriate his critics. Democracy doesn\\'t work \"if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice,\" the president said in his address to Congress this month. \"It doesn\\'t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America.\" That\\'s exactly the right message. If only Obama had heeded it. Let\\'s be clear: The president is not to blame for the polarization of American life. The \"mushy middle\" has been dwindling for years. With Democrats moving to the left and Republicans moving to the right, there is far less overlap between the parties than there was a generation ago. In a recent study, the Pew Research Center found that 92 percent of Republicans are now to the right of the median Democrat, and 94 percent of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican. Worse — much worse — is how intensely hostile the antipathy between right and left has become. Large swaths of each camp say the opposing party is not merely misguided, but an explicit threat to the nation\\'s well-being. Obama could have led the way in suppressing this corrosive tendency. Instead he inflamed it. It would not have required \"the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt\" to eschew the ridicule and taunts that so pollute modern political discourse. The gifts of Gerald Ford would have done nicely. Like all presidents, Obama has been frustrated by partisan opponents. But no chief executive in modern times has been so quick to impugn his critics\\' motives, or to resort to mockery and demonization when amicable persuasion would serve so much better. Obama routinely speaks of his critics as if their motives couldn\\'t possibly be rational or decent. When Republicans balked at his proposal to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees to enter the United States (a proposal I favor), Obama jeered. \"Apparently they\\'re scared of widows and orphans,\" he said. \"That doesn\\'t sound very tough to me.\" When GOP lawmakers resisted raising the debt limit, Obama tweeted: \"Are they really willing to hurt people just to score political points?\" Efforts to repeal Obamacare he attributed to cruelty — the \"one unifying principle\" for Republicans, the president told reporters, is \"making sure that 30 million people don\\'t have health care.\" With Obama, there seems to be no possibility of honorable disagreement. Oppose something he wants, and you are a bought-and-paid-for stooge, or a denier of science, or a peddler of fiction, or a scoundrel who puts party ahead of country. He isn\\'t the only one who talks this way, not by a long shot. But he is our only president, and how he expresses himself matters. When presidential rhetoric is mean and contemptuous, the whole public square is befouled. It can always get worse, as Donald Trump demonstrates daily. But an awful lot of Americans, Republicans and Democrats both, want it to get better. Obama insisted he was going to heal the divide, but never even made the effort. He still has a year in office. It\\'s not too late to start.', 'Donald Trump said in an interview that economic conditions are so perilous that the country is headed for a \"very massive recession\" and that \"it\\'s a terrible time right now\" to invest in the stock market, embracing a distinctly gloomy view of the economy that counters mainstream economic forecasts. The New York billionaire dismissed concern that his comments — which are exceedingly unusual, if not unprecedented, for a major party front-runner — could potentially affect financial markets. \"I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them,\" said Trump, who has misfired on such predictions in the past. \"I don\\'t need them.\" Trump\\'s go-it-alone instincts were a consistent refrain — \"I\\'m the Lone Ranger,\" he said at one point — during a 96-minute interview Thursday in which he talked candidly about his aggressive style of campaigning and offered new details about what he would do as president. The real estate mogul, top aides and his son Don Jr. gathered over lunch at a makeshift conference table set amid construction debris at Trump\\'s soon-to-be-finished hotel five blocks from the White House. Just before, he had met there with his foreign-policy advisers and just after he visited officials at the Republican National Committee — signs that, in spite of his Trump-knows-best manner, the political novice is making efforts to build a more well-rounded bid. [Read the full transcript of the Trump interview] Over the course of the discussion, the candidate made clear that he would govern in the same nontraditional way that he has campaigned, tossing aside decades of American policy and custom in favor of a new, Trumpian approach to the world. In his first 100 days, Trump said, he would cut taxes, \"renegotiate trade deals and renegotiate military deals,\" including altering the U.S. role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He insisted that he would be able to get rid of the nation\\'s more than $19 trillion national debt \"over a period of eight years.\" Most economists would consider this impossible because it could require taking more than $2 trillion a year out of the annual $4 trillion budget to pay off holders of the debt. Trump vehemently disagrees: \"I\\'m renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that we\\'re doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year in trade.\" He said that economic growth he foresees as a consequence of renegotiated deals would enable the United States to pay down the debt — although many economists have said the exact opposite, that a trade war would be crippling to the U.S. economy. Trump also said that the United States has lost its standing in the world and that he would make people \"respect our country. I want them to respect our leader.\" Asked how he would do so, Trump cited an \"aura of personality.\" As a group of world leaders attended President Obama\\'s Nuclear Security Summit less than a mile away, Trump said that, like Obama, he would support full-scale nuclear disarmament but quickly added: \"I love that. But from a practical standpoint, not going to happen.\" Were he to be elected president, Trump said he would want high-level employees of the federal government to sign legally binding nondisclosure agreements so that staffers couldn\\'t write insider accounts of what it\\'s like inside a Trump White House. \"When people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don\\'t like that,\" Trump said. But first, Trump must get elected, and his campaign is struggling through one of its most challenging stretches. In the past week, his campaign manager has been charged with battery for grabbing a reporter, Trump has been criticized for mocking the looks of an opponent\\'s wife as compared with those of his own spouse, and he has backtracked from comments about abortion that offended many in his own party. Trump said that everyone close to him — family, friends, Republican leaders — has been urging him to tone down his attacks and reach out to former rivals, both to reassure wary voters and to begin the difficult process of unifying a party in which many have sworn to never back him. Trump does not intend to take the advice. He said such overtures are \"overrated.\" \"I think the first thing I have to do is win,\" he said. \"Winning solves a lot of problems. And I have two people left\": his two remaining Republican rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. \"Sometimes you have to break an egg,\" Trump said, and Cruz and Kasich were the two remaining eggs. Trump did offer some concessions to the realities of being a political novice, saying that he would not pick an outsider like himself as a vice-presidential running mate, but rather, \"somebody that can walk into the Senate and who\\'s been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years. And can get things done. So I would 95 percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outside.\" In another unprecedented move, Trump said he plans to announce a list of 10 to 12 judges from which he would pick to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court to allay concerns from conservatives that he wouldn\\'t choose someone to their liking. \"I\\'m getting names. The Federalist people. Some very good people. The Heritage Foundation,\" Trump said. \"I\\'m going to announce that these are the judges, in no particular order, that I\\'m going to put up. And I\\'m going to guarantee it. I\\'m going to tell people. Because people are worried that, oh, maybe he\\'ll put the wrong judge in.\" And after a series of violent incidents at his rallies between supporters and protesters, Trump acknowledged that, at least for a little while, he has tried to calm things down. \"We\\'ve purposefully kept the crowds down this past week,\" he said. \"You know, we\\'ve gone into small venues and we\\'re turning away thousands and thousands of people, which I hate, but we didn\\'t want to have the protest. You know, when you have a room of 2,000 people, you can pretty much keep it without the protesters.\" The question posed to Trump about his decision to run: \"Where do you start the movie?\" A wry smile spread over his face as he repeated the question about the moment when he decided to turn what had long been a flirtation with running for the presidency into something real. Asked who he talked to about this critical decision, Trump answered: \"To myself.\" \"To my family, but to myself.\" So it was an interior dialogue? \"This is thought process. And I\\'m saying to myself, you know, look, they put me in these polls. I\\'m number one.\" Trump said his interest really started to pick up in the summer of 2014, when he was still busy with his hit NBC reality show, \"The Apprentice.\" He kept his ambition mostly to himself, slowly thinking it through into early last year, when he hired political advisers, months before he formally jumped in. Trump said his experience throughout the last two years wasn\\'t like 1987, when he first made a speech in New Hampshire that he \"forgot about\" soon after delivering it. This time, as he read the daily newspapers, printed-out online articles (his preferred method of reading) and kept tabs on cable news, he felt the pull. \"I said, \\'You know, this is something I really would like to do.\\' I think I\\'d do it really well. Obviously the public seems to like me,\" Trump recalled. \"I\\'ll tell you a moment when it kicked to yes. Because it was a monetary moment also. . . . There was a moment in, I would say February of last year, so that would be four months, three, four months before I announced, when Steve Burke, great guy, of Comcast . . . came to see me with the top people at NBC. And they wanted to extend my contract.\" Trump told them he was going to run for president instead. \"I just felt there were so many things going wrong with the country,\" Trump said of his thinking at the time. He was frustrated with what he saw as the \"stupidity\" of trade deals and Iran nuclear negotiations that were \"terrible\" and dominated by \"Persians being great negotiators.\" Trump\\'s wife, Melania, heard most of his complaints, but was not enthused about him becoming a candidate. \"She said, \\'We have such a great life. Why do you want to do this?\\' \" \"I said, \\'I sort of have to do it, I think. I really have to do it.\\' . . . I could do such a great job.\" Later, Melania said, \"I hope you don\\'t do it, but if you run, you\\'ll win,\" according to Trump. Now, more than a year later and with the Republican nomination in sight, Trump\\'s family is giving him different advice. \"My family said to me — and Don [Jr.] has said this, and Ivanka, and my wife has said this — \\'Be more presidential.\\' \" Trump said he is getting similar guidance from close friends. He had a story to share. A couple weeks ago, a friend, a famous athlete, called. This was right after Trump beat Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida, the senator\\'s home state. \"That was a big beating. Don\\'t forget, he was the face of the Republican Party. He was the future of the Republican Party. So [the athlete] called me up. And he said, \\'Hey Donald, could you do us all a favor? We love you. Don\\'t kill everybody. Because you may need them on the way back.\\' \" But Trump doesn\\'t see it that way, at least not yet. \"I think you have to break the egg initially,\" he said, adding that he has to beat his opponents and secure the nomination before he is willing to consider reaching out or easing off in any way. When it was suggested that he seems comfortable being the Lone Ranger — the famous old-time TV and radio masked vigilante who fought for good outside the law — Trump immediately concurred. \"I am,\" he said. \"Because I understand life. And I understand how life works. I\\'m the Lone Ranger.\" Asked how he would build a coalition for the general election, Trump responded that he hasn\\'t focused on Hillary Clinton yet — an implication that once he starts attacking her, voters would rally to his side. Pressed on whether it is incumbent on him to tame the anger within his party, Trump said it was, but also: \"I bring rage out. I do bring rage out. I always have. I think it was, I don\\'t know if that\\'s an asset or a liability, but whatever it is, I do. I also bring great unity out, ultimately. I\\'ve had many occasions like this, where people have hated me more than any human being they\\'ve ever met. And after it\\'s all over, they end up being my friends. And I see that happening here.\" Not with everyone, though. Trump acknowledged that he has been \"rough\" and \"nasty\" in debates — so much so that some relationships with his former rivals are likely beyond repair. \"One of the problems I have is that when I hit people, I hit them harder maybe than is necessary,\" he said. \"And it\\'s almost impossible to reel them back.\" Like Rubio, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush. \"Some of the people that I was competing against, I\\'m not sure they can ever go back to me,\" Trump said. \"I was very rough on Jeb.\" It was \"Jeb: Low energy. Little Marco. Names that were devastating.\" Trump seemed unsure whether Cruz would ultimately fit that category. Trump noted that they had gotten along quite well for many months and suggested they could again, but he was also ambivalent about potentially reaching out to Cruz if he beats the senator from Texas for the nomination. \"I\\'ll never have to call him,\" to get his help and support, Trump said, adding that if Cruz did reach out, he would congratulate him. \"Because out of 17 people, you beat 16. Okay? Which is pretty good.\" Still, Trump admitted that he needed to do more outreach. \"Honestly, a lot of people are calling me, but I should be calling them,\" he said. \"Because to a certain extent, I should be calling them, they shouldn\\'t have to be calling me.\" Trump noted that two of his former rivals, Ben Carson and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, are supporting him. As for some others, \"They will be loved. At the right time, they will be loved.\" Asked specifically at this uncertain moment in his campaign whether \"all politics, all successful politics, is about coalition building,\" he responded: \"It\\'s true.\" \"I do,\" Trump said, his arms folded across his familiar dark suit, white shirt and red tie, as he sat in what he hopes will be his newest trophy hotel. \"I agree. I agree.\" Pressed on when that coalition building might begin, he turned to stories about boxing great Muhammad Ali and football coaching icon Vince Lombardi. Ali, he said, earned respect \"through having the goods. You know, so Muhammad Ali is a friend of mine. He\\'s a good guy. I\\'ve watched many people over the years. Muhammad Ali would get in the ring, and he\\'d talk and talk and scream and talk about the ugly bear, and this, that — you know. And then he\\'d win. And respect is about winning. We don\\'t win anymore. I see it in my — we don\\'t win anymore. And he\\'d win. I\\'ve seen many fighters that were better than Muhammad Ali, in terms of talking. I\\'ve seen guys that were so beautiful, so flamboyant, they\\'d get into the ring — and then they\\'d get knocked out. And guess what? It\\'s all gone.\" \"The coalition building for me will be when I win. Vince Lombardi, I saw this. He was not a big man. And I was sitting in a place with some very, very tough football players. Big, strong football players. He came in — these are tough cookies — he came in, years ago — and I\\'ll never forget it, I was a young man. He came in, screaming, into this place. And screaming at one of these guys who was three times bigger than him, literally. And very physical, grabbing him by the shirt. Now, this guy could\\'ve whisked him away and thrown him out the window in two seconds. This guy — the player — was shaking. A friend of mine. There were four players, and Vince Lombardi walked in. He was angry. And he grabbed — I was a young guy — he grabbed him by the shirt, screaming at him, and the guy was literally. . . . And I said, wow. And I realized the only way Vince Lombardi got away with that was because he won.\" Trump has for months contended that the U.S. economy is in trouble because of what he sees as an overvalued stock market, but his view has grown more pessimistic of late and he is now bearish on investing, to the point of warning Americans against doing so. \"I think we\\'re sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble,\" Trump said. He made clear that he was not specifying a sector of the economy but the economy at large and asserted that more bullish forecasts were based on skewed employment numbers and an inflated stock market. \"First of all, we\\'re not at 5 percent unemployment. We\\'re at a number that\\'s probably into the twenties if you look at the real number,\" Trump said. \"That was a number that was devised, statistically devised to make politicians — and, in particular, presidents — look good. And I wouldn\\'t be getting the kind of massive crowds that I\\'m getting if the number was a real number.\" [The bizarre optimism in Donald Trump\\'s theory of the economy] Trump\\'s assertion does not match data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Its analysis of joblessness beyond the unemployed — such as \"marginally attached\" workers and those who have dropped out of the labor force — was under 10 percent nationally last month. Trump\\'s view also runs counter to that of most economists, whose rough consensus is that the U.S. economy has about a 20 percent chance of slipping into recession this year largely because growth remains weak across the world, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists in March. Most economists aren\\'t overly worried about an imminent downturn because job creation remains strong, workers are starting to see their wages grow and the Federal Reserve remains cautious about shifting away from the low-interest-rate stance that has helped stimulate the economy. Any number of Trump\\'s predictions haven\\'t worked out. In 2012, for instance, he predicted that if Obama were reelected, oil and gas prices would go \"through the roof like never before.\" In 2011, Trump said that when Obama\\'s health-care law took effect, national unemployment would \"go even higher\" than 9 percent. He was also bullish on real estate investments in the run-up to the housing bust. Nonetheless, Trump said, \"it\\'s precarious times. Part of the reason it\\'s precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries. We are being ripped so badly by China. It just never ends. Nobody\\'s ever going to stop it. And the reason they\\'re not going to stop it is one of two. They\\'re either living in a world of the make-believe, or they\\'re totally controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests.\" \"I\\'m pessimistic,\" Trump said. \"Unless changes are made. Changes could be made.\" By Trump, for instance: \"I can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly.\" Trump firmly believes that a turnaround on trade would be the necessary beginning of a solution to any looming recession. He mentions the Trans-Pacific Partnership as one pact he would immediately seek to renegotiate, putting him at odds with congressional Republicans who supported giving the president fast-track trade authority last year. Coupled with his push on trade would be a \"very big tax cut,\" which Trump unveiled last September. That proposal increases taxes on the \"very rich\" but reduces taxes for most taxpayers and would cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. To woo companies back to the United States, he would offer an incentive of a deeply discounted rate and would no longer allow corporations to defer taxes on income earned overseas. In the center of Washington on Thursday, world leaders were attending a summit focused on reducing nuclear stockpiles around the world. A day earlier, Trump had made headlines for saying at an MSNBC forum that he would \"possibly\" use a nuclear weapon as president. Less than a week before, in an interview with the New York Times, Trump had suggested that Japan and South Korea should consider acquiring nuclear arms as a way of disengaging the United States from its role as a military protector — a proposal that the Obama White House promptly called \"catastrophic.\" Told that Obama had said in 2010 that his greatest worry is a nuclear device exploding in an American city, Trump at first took a dig at the president. \"It\\'s funny. It\\'s very interesting. I\\'m surprised he said that because I heard him recently say that the biggest problem we have is global warming, which I totally disagree with. Okay?\" Trump said. But after mocking, Trump turned solemn on the topic, calling the nuclear threat the \"single greatest problem\" for global peace. \"You look at Hiroshima and multiply it times a thousand,\" he said, shaking his head. Trump said if other countries would agree to do so simultaneously, he would be open to eliminating nuclear weapons held by the United States. \"If it\\'s done on an equal basis, absolutely,\" he said. But Trump added a caveat. He said as much as he supports the idea of eliminating nuclear weapons, it may not be feasible in the current climate and with countries such as Russia and Pakistan perhaps unwilling to relinquish their arms since they are \"spending a tremendous amount of money.\" \"That\\'s something that in an ideal world is wonderful, but I think it\\'s not going to happen very easily. I would love to see a nuclear-free world. Will that happen?\" Trump said. \"Look, Russia right now is spending a tremendous amount of money on redoing their entire nuclear arsenal.\" Turning to Russia\\'s leader, Vladimir Putin, Trump said he continues to appreciate praise from Putin, even though his human-rights record and incursions into Ukraine and elsewhere have alarmed many. \"I want Putin to respect our country, okay?\" Trump said. \"I think he respects strength. Okay? I think Putin respects strength. And I\\'ve said it before, I think I will get along well with Putin. Now you never know. I don\\'t say that — only a fool would say, \\'I will,\\' but I feel that I will get along well with Putin.\" After talk of Putin and strength, Trump was read a few lines from Jeffrey Goldberg\\'s interview with Obama in the Atlantic, which quotes Obama as saying, \"Real power means you can get what you want without having to exert violence.\" Trump listened carefully and said: \"Well, I think there\\'s a certain truth to that. I think there\\'s a certain truth to that. Real power is through respect. Real power is, I don\\'t even want to use the word, fear. But you know, our military is very sadly depleted. You look at what\\'s going on with respect to our military, and it\\'s depleted from all of the cuts,\" Trump said, noting that he frequently sees advertisements for former U.S. military bases being available for purchase. \"I don\\'t want people to be afraid. I want them to respect our country,\" he said. \"Right now, they don\\'t respect our country.\" Trump said the United States should not retreat from the world but should reevaluate its relationships and role in many international groups and alliances, including NATO. \"First of all, it\\'s obsolete,\" he said. \"Our big threat today is terrorism. Okay? And NATO\\'s not really set up for terrorism. NATO is set up for the Soviet Union more than anything else. And now you don\\'t have the Soviet Union.\" But for Trump, NATO, Putin, nuclear weapons, all of that is for later. For now, against mounting calls from friends, loved ones and fellow Republicans, remains the fight. \"My natural inclination is to win,\" Trump said. \"And after I win, I will be so presidential that you won\\'t even recognize me. You\\'ll be falling asleep, you\\'ll be so bored.\" Jim Tankersley and Evelyn M. Duffy contributed to this report.', 'Libya s eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar was quoted on Friday as saying force must remain an option for imposing order in the country, though he added that a political solution would be preferable. Libya has been mired in turmoil since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that ended Muammar Gaddafi s 42-year rule, giving space to Islamist militants and smuggling networks that have sent hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe via Italy. Italy and other Western states have tried to work with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, but factions aligned with Haftar control eastern Libya and back a rival government. It s obvious that we prefer the political routes, but when these don t work there must be other solutions, Haftar told Italy s Corriere della Sera newspaper in an interview. We are defeating terrorism in Libya not through diplomatic channels, but with weapons. Haftar s comments came as United Nations envoy Ghassan Salame made a renewed push to get rival factions to sign up to a plan to stabilize Libya and take the country toward presidential and parliamentary elections. Haftar spoke to the Corriere after his first official visit to Italy on Tuesday. After the meeting, Italian Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti expressed hope that all parties would support Salame s inclusive political strategy... excluding any military solution . Haftar also said Pinotti had agreed to train his soldiers and urged the revocation of a U.N. arms embargo if European countries are interested in stopping migrants . He also criticized Italian efforts to convert armed groups on the Western coast into anti-smuggling police. It s a big mistake. The Italian government should not be led astray by the militias... Tomorrow they will fight among themselves for a share of the spoils; it will be a never-ending blackmail, Haftar said. Some international media have reported that the leader of one such group, the Anas al-Dabbashi brigade, had received five million euros directly from Italy s secret services to stop the migrant boats. Italy has denied making any direct payments to armed groups. There has been a sharp reduction in migrant departures since the brigade, known previously as one of the country s biggest people smuggling gangs, clamped down on trafficking in July in exchange for promises of legitimacy and state security jobs from the GNA. Almost two weeks ago, fighting broke out in Sabratha between the Dabbashi brigade and its allies and rival cross-town factions.', 'Republicans are starting to rally around their presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, albeit grudingly. Top Republicans such as Paul Ryan have begun to settle into a middle ground where they will endorse Trump, yet speak out against his more racist and xenophobic remarks. That being said, there is still a large number of Republicans out there taking the #NeverTrump pledge.GOP Senator Mike Lee from Utah still has not endorsed Trump. In fact, he is speaking out against him. So much so that he recently launched an attack ad against the presumptive nominee. He has also spoken out against Trump during media interviews. In one recent interview with Newsmax, Lee laid out a small list of grievances against Trump.During the interview, Lee brought up the time that Trump accused Ted Cruz s father (Lee and Cruz are BFF s) conspiring to kill John F. Kennedy, exasperatingly telling Newsmax, He said that. He actually said that. The exchange came after the host kept insisting that Lee should endorse Trump: Well, we can get into that if you want. I mean we can get into the fact that he accused my best friend s father of conspiring to kill JFK, Lee said. We can go through the fact that he has made some statements that some have identified correctly as religiously intolerance. We can get into the fact that he is so unpopular because my sate consists of members who were a religious minority church a people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1839 and statements like that make them nervous. Now look, these things are not something that I couldn t get over if I heard the right things out of him. But if you want to go to why I have concerns, I can go on if you like. I hope I can get over these concerns. I hope Mr. Trump can help me identify them. But don t sit here and tell me Steve that I have no reason to be concerned about Donald Trump. Trump has made a lot of enemies in the Republican Party during his primary campaign run. Trump will not only have to fight off presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, but also the left of lite-fascist members of the Republican Party. Sit back and get some popcorn, Trump s going to have to fend off punches from both the left and the right from now until November.You can start by watching the interview with Lee below. Featured image from Leigh Vogel/Getty Images', 'An Israeli cabinet minister said on Friday the phrasing of U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital suggested an openness to eventual Palestinian control of part of the city, though he predicted Israel would oppose this. Trump s announcement reversed decades of U.S. policy, angering the Arab world and alarming Western allies. But he also said Washington was not laying down a position on final-status issues including boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, which the two parties would have to decide in negotiations. Israel has long deemed Jerusalem its eternal, indivisible capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek on land Israel took in a 1967 war. Its eastern sector is laden with Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites that inject deep religious sensitivities into the dispute over sovereignty. In his speech on Wednesday, Trump did not include words echoing Israel s traditional description of Jerusalem. Asked about this, minister Zeev Elkin said: I think that his leaving this out of the speech was premeditated. He even hinted that borders in Jerusalem will also be set as a result of negotiations, which presupposes an option of partition, said Elkin, who holds the Jerusalem Affairs portfolio in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s government. Elkin was referring to Trump s caveat that the new U.S. decision on Jerusalem did not constitute taking a position of any final-status issues, including the specific boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders . Those questions are up to the parties involved, added Trump, who said Washington still wanted Israelis and Palestinians to agree on a two-state solution for peace. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson echoed those remarks on Friday. With respect to the rest of Jerusalem the president ... did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem. He was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide, Tillerson told reporters in Paris. Like other world powers, and in keeping with U.N. Security Council resolutions since the 1967 war, Washington had long held off on recognizing any sovereignty in Jerusalem, one of the most treacherous issues in the Middle East conflict. Elkin said he would have been happy had Trump described Jerusalem as Israel s united capital. But he played down any possibility of partition, saying Trump s administration would only pursue the idea if the Netanyahu government consented. This is a very, very important factor, and I currently have no doubt that Israel would not agree. Ultimately, in actuality, this is what matters, Elkin said in his remarks, carried by Tel Aviv 102 FM radio. Trump spoke of Jerusalem as the capital the Jewish people established in ancient times (and) the seat of the modern Israeli government, with freedom of worship for all faiths. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas responded angrily, saying Washington had abdicated its role as peace mediator and deeming Jerusalem a Palestinian, Arab, Christian and Muslim city, the eternal capital of the state of Palestine . Abbas used the Arabic term Al Quds , which he has generally qualified to refer to East Jerusalem rather than the whole city. In three public statements welcoming the U.S. move, Netanyahu has not asserted Jerusalem s indivisibility under Israel - heretofore stock rubric for him, as for previous prime ministers. A Netanyahu spokesman did not immediately respond to a Reuters query about the seeming omission. Israel s ambassador to the United States, speaking before the Trump announcement, appeared to acknowledge that - in the eyes of foreign mediators, at least - Jerusalem being the Israeli capital may not rule out Palestinian sovereignty there. Every single peace plan that s ever been put down has Jerusalem be a capital of Israel, Ron Dermer told Politico on Dec. 4. There have been other peace plans that have suggested it be capital of two states, which is a separate issue. Israel annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it. But world powers and the United Nations have not recognized Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, saying it must be negotiated by Israel and the Palestinians, whose last peace talks collapsed in 2014. No other country has its embassy in Jerusalem. Thousands of Palestinians protested in a day of rage on Friday in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and in East Jerusalem against Trump s move on the ancient city.', 'Kenya s Supreme Court on Wednesday criticized the election board for failing to verify official results of last month s presidential election before announcing them, but did not find any individual at the board responsible for the failings. The court was offering a detailed ruling as to why it annulled the Aug. 8 election and ordered a fresh presidential vote within 60 days. The Sept. 1 decision was the first of its kind in Africa. The election board had said incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta won the contest by 1.4 million votes, but opposition leader Raila Odinga challenged the result in the Supreme Court. He says the previous two elections were also stolen from him. Kenya is a key Western ally in a region often shaken by violence. Its status as a diplomatic, trade and security hub for East Africa means the court s ruling and preparation for the fresh election, now scheduled for Oct. 17, are being closely watched for signs of instability or violence. On Monday, the French technology company supporting the election said it would be nearly impossible to be ready for that date. The court s Sept. 1 ruling identified some procedural problems, but the key finding against the election board on Wednesday was that officials had announced results before being able to verify them. Kenya used two parallel systems: a quick electronic tally vulnerable to typos and a slower paper system designed as a verifiable, definitive back-up. The official results were based on the electronic tally before the paper results were fully collated, the judges said. The system was designed that way after a disputed 2007 presidential vote sparked violence that killed around 1,200 people and displaced some 600,000 more. If elections are not seen to be free and fair, they can trigger instability. We do not need to look far for examples, said Chief Justice David Maraga. The board overseeing the 2017 vote did not have all the tally forms when it announced results, and some forms lacked security features like water marks, signatures or serial numbers, which calls their authenticity into question, the court said, adding there was no evidence of individual wrongdoing. Though the petitioner claimed various offences were committed by the issues of the first respondent, that is the IEBC (elections board), no evidence was placed before us to prove that allegation, Maraga said. We are therefore unable to impute any criminal intent or culpability. Odinga has said he will not take part in the repeat election if several demands, including the sacking of senior staff at the election board, are not met. Judge Philomena Mwilu said the forms should have been quickly available for inspection, noting officials said thousands of forms from polling stations were still unavailable four days after the official results were announced. The (board) cannot therefore be said to have verified the results, she said. It is an inexcusable contravention ... of the election act. She also censured the board s refusal to comply with court orders to open its computer servers, saying it meant that opposition claims of hacking or manipulation might be true. Noncompliance or failure by the board to do as ordered must be held against it, she said. But although the tallying process was questioned, voter registration, identification and voting all appeared to have been conducted in accordance with the law, she said. Opposition claims against Kenyatta were largely dismissed. Maraga said the opposition had failed to show evidence Kenyatta had campaigned using state resources or undue influence. Two judges read lengthy dissenting opinions and accused their four colleagues who issued the majority judgment of misinterpreting the law and other failings, including not paying attention to the evidence and judicial limits. As judges spoke, police used tear gas to disperse groups of rival political supporters holding demonstrations outside the Supreme Court. The election re-run has divided Kenya, with many opposition supporters celebrating it and the president and some members of the ruling party criticizing it harshly. After the majority decision was read, Deputy President William Rut tweeted: Evidently a supreme coup on sovereign Will of the people was executed on basis of technicalities against their verdict captured in ballots. On Tuesday, the chief justice told a news conference that judges were getting threats and the police were not offering adequate protection, an allegation that the chief of police denied.', 'The United States is troubled by reports that an Iranian-American man may have been sentenced by Iran to 18 years in prison, a State Department spokesman said on Tuesday, a week after an Iranian-American businessman and his father were also jailed by an Iranian court. \"We are troubled by reports that Robin Reza Shahini, a person reported to be a U.S. citizen, may have been convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison,\" spokesman John Kirby told a daily briefing. He called on Tehran to halt \"arbitrary and politically motivated detentions.\" California-based Shahini was detained while visiting his mother in Gorgan in July, according to Shahini\\'s friends. Last week, businessman Siamak Namazi and his 80-year-old father Baquer Namazi, a former Iranian provincial governor and former UNICEF official, were sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of cooperating with the United States. Iran does not recognize dual nationality, which prevents Western embassies from visiting such detainees. Washington secured the release of five U.S. citizens from Iran in January in a prisoner exchange and has said it raises the detention of other Americans held by Tehran during meetings with Iranian officials. Major world powers, including the United States, reached a landmark nuclear deal with Iran in July last year, which lifted some international sanctions against Iran. \"Nobody is turning a blind eye here, but what is behind this, I don\\'t think any of us know with certainty,\" Kirby said, when asked why Iran keeps detaining dual citizens. \"I can\\'t speak to the motivation behind these detentions but if one of the motivations was to secure ransom, it is a false perception. It is wrong.\" Republican leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives plan a vote as soon as mid-November on a 10-year reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Act, congressional aides told Reuters. The move could increase frustrations in Iran, which has been complaining for months that remaining U.S. sanctions have frightened away trade partners.', 'The big release of the latest National Review edition, with a cover declaring \"Against Trump,\" on Thursday night was above all other things a wonderful gift not just to liberals, but anyone who lives outside of the conservative tribe. Because it gives us a glimpse, however temporary, of what it feels like to be a Trump supporter. I defy readers to take one look at the cover and not feel an overwhelming surge of contempt for these establishment conservatives who love to pander to the camo-crowd when it suits them, but get fussy when the rubes rise up and start demanding real skin in the game. You want to rub their smug little faces right in Donald Trump\\'s ridiculous hair and ask how they like those apples. Any discerning reader knows that, on some level, you\\'re meant to root for the monster to turn on Dr. Frankenstein, for the Pied Piper to take the children away, for Satan to finally come for Dr. Faustus. And so it\\'s impossible not to take pleasure in watching the conservative base come extract its pound of Trump-shaped flesh out of the establishment. It\\'s no mystery why the National Review and their supporters hate Trump. He\\'s vulgar and embarrassing and he does an even better job of exploiting the right-wing rubes and their racism and their provincialism and their ridiculous sense of oppression than they do. They are, in other words, haters. And Trump dismissed them as the haters they are with ease during his press conference Thursday night where he called the National Review a \"dead paper\" that almost no one reads anymore. This impression is driven home by actually reading the issue. The editors can\\'t quite seem to decide what their exact objections to Trump are. Is it that he\\'s driving the right too far in the direction of fascism or that he\\'s a secret liberal in disguise? Both! Whatever you need to hear! The strategy is argument through overwhelming. They\\'ll throw everything they\\'ve got, even contradictory stuff, at the reader and hope the sheer volume of words impresses them enough to vote for Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush. The everything-and-the-kitchen-sink strategy produces some hilarious contradictions. The main anti-Trump editorial, written by the editors, darkly warns that Trump isn\\'t the racist that his followers think he is. \"Trump says he will put a big door in his beautiful wall, an implicit endorsement of the dismayingly conventional view that current levels of legal immigration are fine,\" they write, even trying to get the reader to believe that Trump\\'s mass deportation plan is \"poorly disguised amnesty\". But then, in the writer round-up, we\\'re hearing a different story. \"Not since George Wallace has there been a presidential candidate who made racial and religious scapegoating so central to his campaign,\" David Boaz sniffs, adding that America \"aspired to rise above such prejudices and guarantee life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to everyone.\" So which is it, guys? Is Trump offensive because he\\'s too nativist or because he\\'s not devoted enough to keeping the foreigners out? Whatever will make you not vote for him, I guess. A similar question emerges when it comes to the conservative obsession with masculinity, which they confuse with strength. The editors write that Trump \"has an astonishing weakness for flattery, falling for Vladimir Putin after a few coquettish bats of the eyelashes from the Russian thug.\" On the other hand, Ben Domenech worries that Trump is \"a tyrannical monarch\" who he believes is too eager to \"impose [his] will on the nation\". Mona Charen chimes in agreement, saying \"conservatism implies a certain modesty about government.\" So which is it? Does a big ego make one weak or is the problem that it makes one too strong and authoritarian? Both, I guess! Depends on if you\\'re more of an anxious masculinity conservative or if you\\'re one who likes to delude yourself into believing you\\'re a libertarian sort. Either way, don\\'t vote Trump! The self-contradictions are particularly amusing, to me at least, on the issue of women. Charen denounces Trump for his need to \"constantly to insult and belittle others including, or perhaps especially, women\". But she and many of the other writers also warn the reader about Trump\\'s pro-choice past, insinuating that he\\'s not on board with the anti-choice movement. A movement, may I remind you, that is passing mandatory ultrasound and waiting period laws and other medically unnecessary regulations, for the purpose of insulting and shaming women. This self-important National Review manifesto can\\'t even decide how to feel about the practice of insulting and belittling people. On one hand, as Charen writes, they believe it\\'s a sign of \"a pitifully insecure person\". What then to make of the fact that much of the anti-Trump argument is rooted in cheap shots at the man, from the you\\'re-a-girl insult regarding his behavior around Putin to Mark Helprin\\'s swipe at Trump for having \"hair like the tinsel on discarded Christmas trees\". I guess everyone at the National Review is a \"pitifully insecure person\", so why is it only a crime when said insulter is Donald Trump? Is it because he\\'s better at it than you guys? It\\'s tough to say what the National Review expected out of this, besides selling more issues. And even that has a strong possibility of backfiring, as this attack gave Trump an opportunity to imply, with cause, that they are using his name to bolster their declining sales. If the idea was to pry base voters off Trump, good luck with that. All this does is confirm base voter suspicions that the conservative establishment sees them as a bunch of useful idiots who are to be slapped down the second they start thinking they have a real voice in the movement. If the idea was to take a stand and lay out a clear line between the bellicose base and the more refined party elite, well, that\\'s backfiring, too, as the RNC reacted to all this by disinviting the National Review to partner with them in the Republican debates. In his anti-Trump screed, Ben Domenech gets on his high horse about how ours is supposed to be a \"government of the people, by the people,\" which he claims Trump is threatening. Keep telling yourself that, buddy. Because it looks a whole lot like Trump\\'s popularity is due to \"the people\" revolting against a system where the establishment calls all the shots. And National Review\\'s flailing shows that the establishment has no idea what to do with that.', 'House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday he is \"hopeful\" lawmakers can move legislation on Puerto Rico out of the House before the U.S. territory must make a $1.55 billion debt payment in July. But lawmakers will not be able to address the island\\'s fiscal crisis before May 1, when Puerto Rico is due to make a smaller $422 million payment that Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla says it cannot meet, said the California Republican, who is second only to Speaker Paul Ryan in the legislative chamber. Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in total debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population, all of which threaten to cause its economy to collapse. \"The May date, I don\\'t see how we can get it done,\" McCarthy told reporters. Congressional efforts to craft legislation to address the crisis have hit a series of roadblocks that McCarthy said he believes lawmakers could surmount before July 1, when Puerto Rico is scheduled to make the $1.55 billion debt payment. \"I\\'m hopeful that we\\'d have it out of the House by then,\" the Republican leader said. McCarthy said the House has not produced legislation until now because lawmakers are waiting for the U.S. Treasury Department to complete negotiations with island authorities. Democrats reject the claim, however, saying Republicans are unable to move forward because of internal divisions encouraged by outside groups that have sought to characterize the legislative effort as a taxpayer \"bailout\" despite repeated denials from the House Republican leadership. \"It\\'s our No. 1 principle that we\\'re going to protect the taxpayers and will not do a bailout,\" McCarthy said on Tuesday. \"As soon as we can get Treasury to get done with what they\\'re working on, I think that will put us on a faster path,\" he added.', 'If you\\'re making resolutions for a healthier new year, consider a gut makeover. Refashioning the community of bacteria and other microbes living in your intestinal tract, collectively known as the gut microbiome, could be a good investment in your health. Trillions of microbial cells inhabit the human body, outnumbering human cells by 10 to one according to some estimates, and growing evidence suggests that the rich array of intestinal microbiota helps us process nutrients in the foods we eat, bolsters the immune system and does all sorts of odd jobs that promote sound health. A diminished microbial ecosystem, on the other hand, is believed to have consequences that extend far beyond the intestinal tract, affecting everything from allergies and inflammation, metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity, even mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. Much of the composition of the microbiome is established early in life, shaped by forces like your genetics and whether you were or . Microbial diversity may be further undermined by the typical American diet, rich in sugar, meats and processed foods. But a new study in mice and people adds to evidence that suggests you can take steps to enrich your gut microbiota. Changing your diet to one containing a variety of foods, the new research suggests, may be crucial to achieving a healthier microbiome. Altering your microbiome, however, may not be easy, and nobody knows how long it might take. That\\'s because the ecosystem already established in your gut determines how it absorbs and processes nutrients. So if the microbial community in your gut has been shaped by a daily diet of cheeseburgers and pepperoni pizza, for example, it won\\'t respond as quickly to a healthy diet as a gut shaped by vegetables and fruits that has more varied microbiota to begin with. \"The nutritional value of food is influenced in part by the microbial community that encounters that food,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Gordon, the senior author of the new paper and director of the Center for Genome Science and Systems Biology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Nutritional components of a healthy diet have to be viewed from \"the inside out,\" he said, \"not just the outside in. \" One of the questions the study set out to answer was how individuals with different diets respond when they try to improve their eating habits. The scientists harvested gut bacteria from humans, transplanted them into mice bred under sterile conditions, and then fed the mice either or diets. The scientists then analyzed changes in the mice\\'s microbial communities. Of interest, the scientists harvested the gut bacteria from people who followed sharply different diets. One group ate a fairly typical American diet, consuming about 3, 000 calories a day, high in animal proteins with few fruits and vegetables. Some of their favorite foods were processed cheese, pepperoni and lunch meats. The other group consisted of people who were devotees of calorie restriction. They ate less than 1, 800 calories a day and had meticulously tracked what they ate for at least two years, sticking to a mostly diet and consuming far less animal protein than the other group, a third fewer carbohydrates and only half the fat. This group, the researchers found, had a far richer and more diverse microbial community in the gut than those eating a typical American diet. They also carried several strains of \"good\" bacteria, known to promote health, that are unique to their diet. \"Their choices as adults dramatically influenced their gut community,\" said Nicholas W. Griffin of Washington University, the paper\\'s lead author. The study, published in Cell Host Microbe, is not the first to report findings suggesting dietary shifts can induce persistent changes in a gut microbial community, said Dr. David A. Relman, a professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, who was not involved in the current research. He noted that other studies had found even more profound effects. After the human microbiota was transplanted into the mice, the mice got to eat either like typical Americans or like the calorie restrictors. Mice that had a microbiota conditioned by the typical American diet had a weaker response to the diet. Their microbial communities didn\\'t increase and diversify as much. \"They all responded in a predictable direction, but with not as great a magnitude,\" said Dr. Griffin. Another aspect of the study suggests the company you keep may also enrich your gut microbiota — at least in mice. At first the animals were kept in separate cages. Then, when they were housed together, the microbes from the communities conditioned by plant diets made their way into the microbiome. It\\'s not clear how that translates to humans: Mice eat one another\\'s droppings when they live together, so they easily share the bacterial wealth. Still, it\\'s possible humans have other ways of sharing bacteria, Dr. Griffin said. \"We know from previous work and other studies that spouses who live together will develop microbial communities that are similar to each other,\" he said. Perhaps the best way to cultivate a healthier microbiome is to eat more fiber by consuming more fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts or seeds, said Meghan Jardine, a registered dietitian who was not involved in the current study but has published articles on promoting a healthy microbiota. (She is also affiliated with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which recommends a diet.) She urges people to aim for 40 to 50 grams of fiber daily, well above levels recommended by most dietary guidelines. \"When you look at populations that eat real food that\\'s high in fiber, and more foods, you\\'re going to see they have a more robust microbiota, with more genetic diversity, healthier species and fewer pathogenic bacteria living in the gut,\" she said.', 'Frankfurt s city center, an area including police headquarters, two hospitals, transport systems and Germany s central bank storing $70 billion in gold reserves will be evacuated on Sunday to allow the defusing of a 1.8 ton World War Two bomb. A spokesman for the German Bundesbank said, however, the usual security arrangements would remain in place while experts worked to disarm the bomb, dropped by the British air force and uncovered during excavation of a building site. The Bundesbank headquarters, less than 600 meters from the location of the bomb, stores 1,710 tonnes of gold underground, around half the country s reserves. We have never defused a bomb of this size, bomb disposal expert Rene Bennert told Reuters, adding that it had been damaged on impact when it was dropped between 1943 and 1945. Airspace for 1.5 kilometers around the bomb site will also be closed. Frankfurt city officials said more than 60,000 residents would be evacuated for at least 12 hours. The evacuation area would also include 20 retirement homes, the Opera house and the diplomatic quarter. Bomb disposal experts will make use of a Rocket Wrench to try and unscrew the fuses attached to the HC 4,000 bomb. If that fails, a water jet will be used to cut the fuses away from the bomb, Bennert told Reuters. The most dangerous part of the exercise will be applying the wrench, Bennert said. Roads and transport systems, including the underground, will be closed during the work and for at least two hours after the bomb is defused, to allow patients to be transported back to hospitals without traffic. It is not unusual for unexploded bombs from World War Two air raids to be found in German cities, but rarely are they so large and in such a sensitive position.', \"iTS DARK ALRIGHT .

Those agencies proclaim this with a rock-solid conviction that I have not heard since Vice President DIck Cheney told us all that \"there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.\" Add to that, the rock-solid evidence of Saddam\\'s treachery that Colin Powell presented to the UN Security Council. The mainstream corporate media bought it whole. However, as all know today, these were lies. Saddam had no WMDs, and there were no Iraqi chemical weapons \"Winebagos of Death\" vividly described by Colin Powell. Now we are told, \"with high confidence,\" that Vladimir Putin\\'s Kremlin has launched a cyber attack to disrupt our presidential election. Never mind that, as MIT expert Theodore Postol has written that there is, \"no technical way that the US intelligence community could know who did the hacking if it was done by sophisticated nation-state actors.\" The lies that launched the disastrous Iraq war have had lasting consequences to the credibility of the United States Government. The last time that government cried \"wolf,\" there was no wolf. Why should we believe it now? So no, I am not convinced. There is good reason not to believe the \"Kremlin hack\" story. A crucial distinction is in order: First, there is the actual content of the hacked emails. Second, there are the consequences of the general media assumption and public belief that the emails were a Kremlin plot to disrupt the presidential election. As for the content , it was trivial and still worse, not credible. There is nothing remarkable in the disclosed content of the hacked emails. They might, if believed, cause John Podesta some embarrassment. In addition, they might reveal that the Democratic National Committee is controlled by a political elite. But we already know that. But why should we believe any of that content? If, as claimed, the leaks came from the Kremlin, there is not, and cannot be, any authentication of the hacked emails unless the original sources (e.g, John Podesta) produce the originals. And why would they? Accordingly, the leakers (whoever they might be) are free to concoct forgeries at will. And of course, it follows that we, the intended audience, are advised to ignore all of them. Furthermore, , why would Putin want to use these emails to \"rig\" our election? To tilt the election toward Trump? If that is his motive, it has backfired spectacularly. That alleged \"disclosure\" of the hacking has benefited Clinton far more than Trump. It is one of her favorite talking points, as we discovered in the final debate. So we are left with two alternate conclusions: The Russian government likely had no part in the leaking. Or if they did, the leaks will have little or no effect on the election, except to provide Hillary Clinton with a talking point and to embarrass John Podesta. In short, the Wikileaks hacks, whatever the source, appear to be a just a prank: A trifle, blown hugely out of proportion by a scandal-hungry media. However, even though the content of the hacked emails may be trivial and not credible, the consequences of the accusation of Kremlin connivance could be catastrophic. First of all, as we are finding out, the neo-cons and the media are using the hacks to intensify the demonization of Putin and to heat up the renewed Cold War. Still worse, as Joe Biden stated recently on Meet the Press , the accusation that Putin is behind the hacks and their release might provoke a cyber retaliation from the United States. A Kremlin spokesman has called Biden\\'s threat a a \"virtual American declaration of war on Russia.\" If, as Biden warns, the United States retaliates, then the Russian response might, unlike the present alleged leaks, be devastating to the US economy. Be assured that a \"cyber-war\" entails infinitely more than leaked emails. It might include the shutdown of the internet and emails. Also, the disruption of business and financial communications and utility grids. The world today runs on silicon and microprocessors. Imagine returning home to no electric power, phone service or access to the internet. Add to that, no restocking of the local supermarket or gas stations. And no capability of the government to make prompt repairs. The result: Total economic shutdown. We can do this to Russia, and be assured that Russia can do this to us. The reality of cyber attacks is no mere speculation, we have seen them at work. The Iranian nuclear weapons program was severely damaged and set back by a CIA implanted computer virus. And this past month, large regions of the United States temporarily lost internet service. The cause remains unknown. Has Joe Biden thought through the implications of his threat? Is this the horror that Biden wants to unleash on us and the world in response to an essentially harmless prank? To what purpose? Some kind of capitulation by the Russians? No chance of that. A far more likely result would be an escalation from cyber to military combat. And then what? Where are the cool-headed grownups, now that we need them?

Eyes to the skies.Luke 21:26 King James Version (KJV)26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.\", 'Thick with tension, the conversation this week between Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist, and Jared Kushner, the president\\'s and senior adviser, had deteriorated to the point of breakdown. Finally, Mr. Bannon identified why they could not compromise, according to someone with knowledge of the conversation. \"Here\\'s the reason there\\'s no middle ground,\" Mr. Bannon growled. \"You\\'re a Democrat. \" The schism within Mr. Trump\\'s perpetually fractious White House has grown in recent weeks, fueled by personality, ideology and ambition. At its core are Mr. Bannon, the edgy, nationalist suddenly in the seat of power, and Mr. Kushner, the polished, scion of New Jersey and New York real estate. Even as Mr. Kushner\\'s portfolio of responsibilities has been expanding, Mr. Bannon\\'s in recent days has shrunk with the loss of a national security post. The escalating feud, though, goes beyond mere West Wing melodrama, the sort of who\\' \\' scorekeeping that typically consumes Washington. Instead, it reflects a larger struggle to guide the direction of the Trump presidency, played out in disagreements over the policies Mr. Trump should pursue, the people he should hire and the image he should put forward to the American people. On one side are Mr. Bannon\\'s guerrilla warriors, eager to close the nation\\'s borders, dismantle decades of regulations, empower police departments and take on the establishment of both parties in Washington. On the other are Mr. Kushner\\'s \"Democrats,\" an appellation used to describe even Republicans who want to soften Mr. Trump\\'s rough edges and broaden his narrow popular appeal after months of historically low poll numbers. In the middle is Mr. Trump himself, seemingly torn between the two factions, tilting one way or the other depending on the day, or even the hour, while he seeks to recapture momentum after a series of defeats in Congress and the courts. As he did throughout his career in business and entertainment, Mr. Trump plays advisers off one another, encouraging a sort of competition for influence and ideas within his circle, so long as everyone demonstrates loyalty to him. At different moments, Mr. Trump has given conflicting impressions of his preferences. He has privately scorned the coverage of Mr. Kushner\\'s recent trip to Iraq, according to two people who spoke with him, and questioned the need for his \\'s newly created office to overhaul the government. At other points, he has been dismissive of Mr. Bannon, curtly telling him he is not needed at this meeting or that. \"This president\\'s method of managing is by him personally curating points of views from a diverse group of people in whom he has some trust and credibility,\" said Thomas Barrack Jr. a longtime friend of Mr. Trump who led his inaugural festivities. \"And he very rarely accepts one course of action or one suggestion without laundering it amongst all of them. And what happens in that process is confusion amongst those from whom he\\'s seeking advice. What works for him is that, out of that milieu, his instincts take him to the right answer. \" But the main players have grown so wary of leaving Mr. Trump\\'s side that it has become hard to organize meetings of senior officials without him, to thrash through policies or hiring choices, slowing up an already fitful process. Meanwhile, the conflicting sides have been waging proxy battles through friendly news media outlets. While alliances have been fluid in this White House, Mr. Kushner is joined by more advisers including not only his wife, Ivanka Trump, who now has her own West Wing office, but also Gary Cohn, the president\\'s national economics adviser, and Dina Powell, a deputy national security adviser, both veterans of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Bannon\\'s closest ally is Stephen Miller, the president\\'s senior adviser for policy and the author of orders to temporarily ban visitors from certain predominantly Muslim countries. And although they were once at odds and still come from vastly different vantage points, Mr. Bannon has also maintained an alliance of convenience lately with Reince Priebus, the chief of staff closely associated with the Republican Party establishment. In recent weeks, as Mr. Bannon has felt increasingly frustrated, Mr. Priebus has several times bolstered the chief strategist in discussions with the president, according to people with direct knowledge of the talks. In turn, Mr. Bannon has gone out of his way to praise his onetime rival\\'s performance. Mr. Kushner and the others are said to be especially concerned about the geyser of bad headlines that have marked the president\\'s first two and a half months in office. They have resisted many of the more polarizing policy initiatives favored by Mr. Bannon\\'s side, including the travel ban and rollbacks of environmental regulation and of protections for transgender students, arguing that they undercut Mr. Trump\\'s election night pledge to be a president for all Americans. On foreign policy, Mr. Kushner is more inclined toward intervention in the Middle East while Mr. Bannon would prefer that the United States remain as uncommitted as possible. Even as the president signaled this week that he might respond militarily to the chemical attack on civilians in Syria, Mr. Bannon has argued that American interests are better served by not getting drawn any further into the quagmire of a civil war. From his point of view, Mr. Bannon describes the struggle in militaristic terms, vowing to associates that he \"won\\'t give an inch. \" He tells Mr. Trump that there is no political benefit to drifting even slightly toward the center on core issues like the Mexican border wall, immigration and the environment, while he argues against a large infrastructure spending package without a clear way to pay for it. Mr. Bannon argues that it would be a fool\\'s errand to try to placate Democrats on Capitol Hill. That is a view shared by Mr. Priebus, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. If Mr. Trump made a deal on health care with Democrats, Mr. Priebus told the president, it would jeopardize his chances of winning the Republican nomination in 2020, according to a person present for the conversation. The split has widened in a White House filled with aides facing constant questions from reporters about their place. Kellyanne Conway, the president\\'s counselor and once the most prominent face of the White House, has been less visible after several public misstatements. Sean Spicer, the press secretary known for combative encounters with reporters, is struggling to match his aggressive boss\\'s expectations. And Mr. Trump\\'s penchant for polling outsiders about his staff fosters tension. Mr. Priebus remains in a hot spot. Mr. Trump is fond of asking visitors, \"How do you think Reince is doing?\" and he expressed anger at the collapse of the health care overhaul, telling a longtime associate last week that he believed that Mr. Priebus was partly to blame. One of Mr. Priebus\\'s top deputies, Katie Walsh, left the White House unexpectedly last week, and he has been alarmed by a spate of stories questioning his relationships with the president and with Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Priebus personally reached out to two administration officials urging them to push back with journalists reporting on tension with Mr. Pence. Anxious for a victory, Mr. Priebus hastily convened a meeting with Mr. Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan and others in his corner office on Wednesday night and pressed for a quick vote on the health care repeal package, or some element of it, before the House left for its spring recess on Thursday. Mr. Ryan, who is close to Mr. Priebus, rejected the idea, explaining that the Republican leadership needed more time to secure votes to pass anything. Similarly, Mr. Bannon has told associates that he has been frustrated by recent setbacks and has resolved to dig in hard. He has been prodded by his longtime financial patron, Rebekah Mercer, the conservative philanthropist and political donor, according to White House insiders. But she was in little position to help him, since Mr. Trump is said to have grown weary of the Mercers\\' seeking to enforce control over outside groups supporting him. The wrestling match has spilled over into public view as each camp seeks reinforcements among news media and conservative figures. Roger J. Stone Jr. an adviser to Mr. Trump for 30 years, accused Mr. Kushner of planting negative views of Mr. Bannon on MSNBC\\'s \"Morning Joe,\" a show the president is known to watch. \"Many of the Bannon stories that you see, the themes that you see on \\'Morning Joe,\\' are being dictated by Kushner, while Mr. Kushner\\'s plate is very full with Middle Eastern peace and the China visit and so on,\" Mr. Stone said this week on the radio show hosted by Alex Jones, an avid fan of Mr. Trump\\'s who loathes establishment figures and traffics in conspiracy theories. Mr. Bannon\\'s supporters are publicly warning about the subversion of Mr. Trump\\'s real agenda by the Democrats. \"This isn\\'t about palace intrigue,\" Laura Ingraham, the conservative radio host and author who was one of Mr. Trump\\'s earliest backers, said in an interview. \"This is about a assault against the Trump agenda from within. If the president allows this to continue and drifts away from his key pledges, he risks losing his core constituency and any hope of a second term. \"', 'While many Miami hospitals are shutting down as Hurricane Irma bears down on Florida, some are offering shelter to their pregnant patients, bracing for the increase in births that often accompanies these large storms. At least three of the city s hospitals have plans in place to care for women with advanced or high-risk pregnancies. They could be busy. When Houston was hit by Hurricane Harvey, the number of women who gave birth spiked. According to a Memorial Hermann Health System representative, at least five of the not-for-profit system s 11 Houston-area hospitals with labor and delivery units reported increases in the number of deliveries during Hurricane Harvey. In three, deliveries doubled. The reason may have something to do with a drop in barometric pressure that accompanies a hurricane. A 2007 study published in the Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics noted a causal relationship between low barometric pressure and spontaneous delivery. But overall, the evidence is inconclusive, said Dr. Shannon Clark, an associate professor in the division of maternal fetal medicine at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, on the Gulf of Mexico. There s some studies that show an association and some that don t. It s kind of mixed, Clark said in a telephone interview. Even so, she said, It s still worth it to forewarn pregnant women in areas that are going to get hit that there could be a potential complication. In Miami, Jackson Health System alerted women who are at least 34 weeks pregnant or who have a high-risk pregnancy that they may take shelter in one of three of its hospitals, as long as they have registered with the hospital in advance. These women are allowed to bring in one guest, but no pets. Tania Leets, a spokeswoman for the public health system which serves Miami-Dade County, said they offered the same service last year during Hurricane Matthew. Baptist Health South Florida offers shelter to women in Miami who are at least 36 weeks pregnant or who have a high-risk pregnancy in one of its four area hospitals. A pregnant woman and one adult companion can set up camp in a waiting room area; those who come must bring their own food, water and bedding. The shelter opens at 8 a.m. on Saturday and closes when the storm has passed, Baptist Health South said in a statement. Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach will likewise shelter women who are at least 36 weeks pregnant or those with high-risk pregnancies, according to a statement on its website. At Memorial Hermann Greater Heights Hospital in Houston, deliveries started to soar two days before Hurricane Harvey arrived, requiring five managers to help with patient care. We all know in this business - full moons and storms are a problem, said Kim Kendall, director of the hospital s family birth center. Staff made an effort to close the shades, redirect the conversation and focus on the delivery. We tried to maximize the experience and minimize the hurricane, said Kendall.', \"Email Print This is WHY Comey wrote the letter.

They say they will not bring up Merrick Garland for a vote as a Supreme Court Nominee but will wait for the new administration. McConnell is done if he goes back on his word. He spoke on the Senate floor today to say that the Senate will not take up this vote. SIX REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY LL MEET WITH GARLAND:Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio)One of the five things below is a BIG deal breaker Judge Garland is anti-Second Amendment 1. Garland is considered anti-Second Amendment. As the National Review noted last week: Back in 2007, Judge Garland voted to undo a D.C. Circuit court decision striking down one of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation and voted to uphold an illegal Clinton-era regulation that created an improvised gun registration requirement. Obama will use his pick to pursue a gun control agenda.2. Garland has favored environmental regulations. As SCOTUSblog noted in 2010: On environmental law, Judge Garland has in a number of cases favored contested EPA regulations and actions when challenged by industry, and in other cases he has accepted challenges brought by environmental groups. That could be very important, with Obama s Clean Power Plan in the balance.3. Garland s positions on abortion and social issues are murky. Some liberals are worried that Garland may not be unambiguously pro-choice. Richard Wolf of USA Today writes: During 19 years at the D.C. Circuit, Garland has managed to keep a low profile. The court s largely administrative docket has left him without known positions on issues such as abortion or the death penalty. 4. Garland would maintain the Court s demographic profile. He is the second Chicagoan Obama has nominated. He is no wise Latina, and is the first man Obama has chosen. But Garland, like Scalia, is a graduate of Harvard Law, keeping the number of Crimson justices at five. If confirmed, he would also be the fourth Jew on the Court, preserving the odd exclusion of evangelical Protestants.5. Republicans have supported Garland in the past. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) in particular has been outspoken in his support for Garland as the best Republicans could expect from the Clinton administration. More recently, he suggested he would welcome Garland s nomination but predicted that Obama would make a more ideological pick. That makes Garland harder for the GOP to oppose.', 'Clinton s radicalized rhetoric has championed both bans on what she calls weapons of war, and the Australian model of gun buybacks under the threat of government force.Actual weapons of war machine guns and selective-fire firearms have not been manufactured for the civilian market for 30 years, and cannot be, due to the Hughes Amendment to the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA).Yes, you heard that correctly. Despite serial lies by Democrats and the mainstream media, actual military rifles are not manufactured for the American market and haven t been on over a generation.What Clinton actually wants to ban are the most common firearms sold in the United States. This includes common hunting rifles, target rifles, many popular handguns, standard rifle and pistol magazines, and if Clinton follows Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey s deranged lead, could result in the majority of firearms designed in the past 100 years being banned.The threat of new federal gun laws is even more pronounced if gun owners unhappy with their choice of Presidential candidates, opt to sit the 2016 elections out entirely, and Democrats manage to gain seats in the House and Senate, or even win majorities outright.In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Brady Campaign (former called the National Council to Control Handguns and Handgun Control, Inc.) used deep-pocketed gun control supporters to finance what was known as lawfare. Anti-gun attorneys would look for people to use as patsies to serve as plaintiffs in frivolous civil lawsuits against gun dealers, distributors, and manufacturers. The goal of these suits were always transparent, and always the same. These gun control supporters didn t really care if they won or lost their cases, or if their plaintiff patsies were ripped to emotional shreds; their goal was then (and remains now) to force gun dealers, distributors, and manufacturers to have to hire expensive attorneys and spend hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in legal fees to defend themselves in court.PLCAA was passed into law specifically to keep a handful of gun control supporting billionaires from bankrupting the American gun industry from top to bottom with frivolous lawsuits. Hillary Clinton wants to repeal PLCAA so that her allies, such as Michael Bloomberg, can then finance wave after wave of lawsuits to bankrupt gun companies with exorbitant legal fees.If Clinton is successful in her goal of repealing PLCAA which she could very conceivably do if she is elected in a wave that sees Democrats pick up seats in the House and Senate then no gun dealer or manufacturer, or sporting goods store, or ammunition company, would be immune to frivolous lawsuits, and all would be sued out of business.You would not be able to buy new guns, because there would be no manufacturers or importers after they were targeted, one-by-one.In many states where universal background checks are required, you would not be able to buy, sell, or trade existing guns, as dealer after dealer would be sued out of business.You would not be able to buy ammunition for your existing guns, as ammunition companies would also be targeted for extermination, as Brady tried to do against Lucky Gunner as recently as last year (only to have their case struck down by a judge citing PLCAA).This truly is an all or nothing election, folks.If you own any firearm of any kind, for any reason, or ever want to own a firearm for any reason, electing Hillary Clinton is simply non-viable.I know that there are Republicans, Democrats, third-party voters and political agnostics who aren t thrilled with their choices of Presidential candidates this year. I m certainly not.I will tell you that if she is elected, Hillary Clinton will seek to destroy not just your right, but your ability to own, trade, and shoot the most common firearms in the United States.All of them, without exception.This includes your bolt-action deer rifle, your pump shotgun, your grandfather s heirloom revolver, the pistol you purchased for self defense, and the little .22 rifle you learned to shoot as a kid.Consider yourself warned, and vote strategically to protect the Constitution and the right to bear arms against the most dangerous and corrupt candidate to ever be nominated for President. Bearing Arms', 'RALEIGH, N. C. — In the feverishly manicured spectacle that is electoral politics, there are few distractions quite as imposing to candidates as a small child. Just this week, Donald J. Trump earned a wave of negative headlines after he confronted a crying baby at a rally in Virginia. Mike Pence learned that lesson the hard — and perhaps revealing — way at a rally here on Thursday morning when he solicited a question from an boy, Matthew Schricker. \"I\\'ve been watching the news lately, and I\\'ve been noticing that you\\'ve been kind of softening up on Mr. Trump\\'s policies and words,\" Matthew said skeptically. \"Is this going to be your role in the administration?\" Mr. Pence stood for a moment before offering an uneasy chuckle. \"What did you say I\\'ve been doing?\" Mr. Pence asked over laughter from the crowd. \"You\\'ve been kind of softening up on his words,\" Matthew steadfastly replied. Many political analysts far Matthew\\'s senior have been pondering the same thought. In the past week and a half, Mr. Pence has taken divergent stances from (or cleaned up after) his running mate on a series of issues, including the possibility of Russia\\'s hacking Hillary Clinton\\'s email, the treatment of the Khan family and the candidacy of Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Pence tried to regain his footing by complimenting his interlocutor. \"No. 1, this boy has a future,\" Mr. Pence pronounced. \"Nicely done. \" After predicting that Matthew would one day be governor of North Carolina, Mr. Pence tried to fill the gaps between some of his positions and those of his more bombastic running mate by attributing their differences to manner rather than matter. \"Sometimes things don\\'t always come out like you mean, right?\" Mr. Pence said. \"And Donald Trump and I are absolutely determined to work together and we have different styles, you might have noticed that. \" Then Mr. Pence added, in a typical stroke of that has become a necessary weapon in his campaign arsenal, \"You know, I said at our convention, I said we\\'d nominated someone who is larger than life, known for charisma, so they wanted to kind of balance the ticket. \" Mr. Pence said he wanted to make one thing clear to his young skeptic. \"Differences in style, Matthew, should never be confused with differences in conviction,\" he said. \"And I will tell you right now Donald Trump has the right vision for America, he has the right policies for America and I\\'m going to fight every day to tell his story all across the United States. \" Matthew seemed persuaded. \"I was a little worried about him, and I just wanted to make sure he was totally loyal to Mr. Trump and the Republican Party,\" Matthew said after the event had ended. \"And now I think he is. \" At future gatherings, Mr. Pence may wish to pick on someone his own size.', 'Campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination took a nasty turn on Wednesday with billionaire businessman Donald Trump accusing rival Ted Cruz of fraud as the field of candidates narrowed ahead of next week\\'s New Hampshire primary. Rand Paul, a U.S. senator from Kentucky with a libertarian philosophy, pulled out of the Republican race. Conservative Rick Santorum also exited the race on Wednesday and endorsed U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Both Paul and Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, did poorly in Monday\\'s Iowa caucuses, which were won by Cruz, with Trump and Rubio finishing second and third. The caucuses were the first of the state-by-state nominating contests ahead of the Nov. 8 election to replace Democratic President Barack Obama. Trump, a real estate mogul and former reality TV star, went on Twitter on Wednesday to accuse the conservative U.S. senator from Texas of stealing his victory in Iowa. Cruz\\'s team hit back by telling Trump to seek help for addiction to the social media site. The two men are going head-to-head for voters in New Hampshire, where Cruz\\'s evangelical Christian credentials will not likely be as helpful as they were in Iowa. Opinion polls show Trump with a roughly 20-point lead in New Hampshire before next Tuesday\\'s primary. As the New Hampshire race heats up, the Democratic presidential contenders will face off later on Wednesday in a town hall-style event hosted by CNN. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton narrowly beat Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, in Iowa. Trump called for the nullification of Cruz\\'s Iowa victory or a new vote in the state. \"Ted Cruz didn\\'t win Iowa, he stole it,\" Trump said in a series of tweets. \"That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!\" \"Oh that voter fraud, you know, these politicians are brutal,\" Trump said later at a rally in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"They are a bunch of dishonest cookies, I want to tell you.\" Trump referred to an email that Cruz\\'s campaign sent on Monday that implied another Republican candidate, Ben Carson, was about to drop out of the race and that his Iowa backers should be urged to vote for the Texan instead. Cruz later apologized for the email. Trump also accused Cruz\\'s team of sending out a mailer designed to look like an official electoral document to scare Iowa voters into turning out at the caucuses. The accusations were the latest aggressive tactic from Trump, who has courted controversy with attacks on other candidates and by urging a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and branding Mexican immigrants as criminals. Obama visited a mosque near Baltimore on Wednesday, declaring that attacks on Islam were an attack on all faiths, in a move to counter rhetoric from Trump and other Republican candidates that have alienated Muslims. The Cruz campaign said Trump\\'s complaint was a cry for attention after the senator came from behind in the polls to win on Monday. A Cruz spokesman suggested he seek help for \"Twitter addiction.\" \"It is no surprise that Donald is throwing yet another temper-tantrum, or if you like, yet another Trumpertantrum,\" Cruz said. \"I understand that Donald finds it very hard to lose … but at the end of the day, the Iowa people spoke.\" Cruz won support in Iowa from much of the same conservative Christian constituency that helped Santorum to victory in the Iowa caucuses during the 2012 presidential campaign. But Santorum failed to take off in the 2016 race. He said on Fox News he was suspending his run and called Rubio a \"born leader.\" The endorsement came as Rubio came under attack by rivals seeking to curry favor in New Hampshire. Rubio said he looked forward to teaming up with Santorum. \"We want to use him as often as he\\'s willing to work for us,\" Rubio said. Earlier on Wednesday, Paul became the second Republican to drop out of the race since the Iowa caucuses, after former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.

After all, he said mean things about Muslims and Mexicans and threatened to blow up the entire government. But despite the fact that Trump has already caused significant damage and issued executive orders targeting Muslims and Latinos, Coulter is apparently moving closer toward saying that Trump s opponents were right. I m not very happy with what has happened so far, Coulter told the Daily Caller. I guess we have to try to push him to keep his promises. But this isn t North Korea, and if he doesn t keep his promises I m out. This is why we voted for him. I think everyone who voted for him knew his personality was grotesque, it was the issues. Indeed, even what Trump said about grabbing women by their genitals without their consent was not enough to turn Coulter against him. All the sexual assault allegations, the business fraud, and the complete lack of knowledge about how government and the world works did not sway Coulter at all. She voted for Trump and sang his praises by writing books in support of him.Even the evidence that Trump is not even close to being the deal maker he bragged to be was not enough. Yet, Coulter is now whining about how terrible Trump is at negotiating as if she wasn t previously warned. Where is the great negotiation? she asked. Where is the bull in the china shop we wanted? That budget the Republicans pushed through was like a practical joke Did we win anything? And this is the great negotiator? Coulter then conceded that things don t look good and compared Trump s presidency to a road trip gone wrong.It s not like I m out yet, but boy, things don t look good. I ve said to other people, It s as if we re in Chicago and Trump tells us he s going to get us to LA in six days. But for the first three days we are driving towards New York. Yes, it is true he can still turn around and get us to LA in three days, but I m a little nervous.Coulter even admits that at least one thing Trump has done is fascist.I have from the beginning been opposed to Trump hiring any of his relatives. Americans don t like that, I don t like that. That s the one fascist thing he s done. Hiring his kids.Yeah, never mind the deportation force that is literally rounding up Latinos like the Nazis did to the Jews. Never mind the fact Trump has signed executive orders targeting people just because of their religious beliefs. Never mind the fact that Trump is aligned with the interests of corporations. Never mind that he treats women like shit. Never mind that he has repeatedly attacked the free press and uses Fox News as his personal propaganda machine. Coulter thinks Trump has just done one fascist thing by giving his daughter an office in the White House. Somebody needs to give Coulter a refresher course on what fascism is.Trump s poll numbers continue to drop and his policies are set to destroy millions of lives and put the world on course for World War III but Coulter still isn t ready to turn against him just yet despite using words like nightmare and disaster to describe Trump s tenure thus far.I ll say we had no choice, but the Trump-haters were right It s a nightmare. I can t even contemplate that. Right now I m still rooting for him to turn around and take us toward LA It s just that it has been such a disaster so far.But Coulter did have a choice. The Republican field of candidates in 2016 was bigger than it ever has been. She literally had over a dozen choices. But she chose a whining loudmouth ignoramus over candidates like Jeb Bush or John Kasich, who would have been far better and saner than Trump. She just wants to watch the world burn and she is disappointed that Trump hasn t destroyed it fast enough.', 'President-elect Donald Trump faced criticism from an unusual source on Wednesday when a buttoned-down U.S. government ethics office issued an apparently sarcastic stream of Twitter messages applauding him for selling off his assets. Trump, in fact, has not said whether he will sell the hotels, golf courses and other businesses that make up his global Trump Organization, as the U.S. Office of Government Ethics subsequently acknowledged. But the agency sent out a series of tweets as if he had done just that. \"OGE is delighted that you\\'ve decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!\" one tweet said. \"We told your counsel we\\'d sing your praises if you divested, we meant it.\" Trump promised only that he will be \"leaving his great business in total\" in a series of early morning tweets, one of his most common methods of communicating. Democratic lawmakers and other critics said Trump\\'s business interests could pose conflicts of interest when he takes office on Jan. 20 because he will be in a position to influence tax laws, environmental regulations and other government policies that could affect his assets. Ethics office spokesman Seth Jaffe said Trump would more clearly resolve potential conflicts if he sold off his assets, rather than simply transferring control. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Previous presidents have opted to put their savings and investments into blind trusts so they do not know how their decisions in office influence their personal fortunes. Republican Trump, also a former reality TV star who has never previously held public office, has said this would be impractical because it would be difficult to sell off apartment buildings and other properties. He said on Wednesday he is drawing up legal documents that would remove him from day-to-day business operations. He said he would provide details on Dec. 15 at a news conference with his adult children, who are all involved in his enterprises. \"While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as president, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\" Trump tweeted. Democratic lawmakers said that announcement was \"vague\" and urged Republicans who control Congress to hold hearings. Sixteen Democratic members of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee wrote a letter asking whether Trump will transfer his assets to his children; whether his children will be involved in his administration; and whether businesses, foreign governments, and others will \"continue to be able to take actions that benefit Mr. Trump and his family.\" Democrats need the committee\\'s Republican chairman, Representative Bob Goodlatte, to agree to move forward with hearings. A Goodlatte spokeswoman said she did not expect the chairman would have a statement.', 'This year\\'s holiday advertising campaign for the United States Postal Service featured a little girl\\'s stunningly infectious musical plea: \"I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas. \" (And, as she explains, \"Only a hippopotamus will do. \") The ditty was, perhaps, unfamiliar to many listeners, but it penetrated the mind space of the unwary at warp speed — and stayed there. Resistance was futile. Unexpectedly, the song has also upended the quiet retirement of Gayla Peevey, 73, a former child star who recorded the novelty hit in 1953. At the time, the song landed her on the Ed Sullivan show \"Toast of the Town. \" Since November, television viewers have been able to enjoy (and enjoy) that same recording in the omnipresent post office commercial. \"The song could drive you crazy,\" Ms. Peevey conceded. But it doesn\\'t drive her crazy — not at all. \"I love hearing it, and I can\\'t hear it too much,\" she said recently by telephone. Before all the recent hippo hoopla, Ms. Peevey, the former owner of a boutique advertising agency in El Cajon, Calif. had spent her days immersed in good works: for nonprofits and serving on the board of one of them singing in her church choir leading a Bible study group for women. She and her husband of 53 years, Cliff Henderson, a retired elementary school teacher, frequently drive to Los Angeles from their home in La Mesa to visit their daughter, and three grandchildren. There are trips to Hawaii with three other couples, weekly taco nights with those travel companions and \"date day\" every Friday with Cliff. A full and active life, yes. But a few years ago, Ms. Peevey — generally a sunny soul — was starting to feel a little down. \"I saw other people retiring from these big careers, and I started to wonder, \\'What have I really accomplished in life? \\'\" she said. \"I really prayed about it. And I think God decided to throw some blessings on me. \" Ms. Peevey was aware, of course, that the Lord works in mysterious ways, so she\\'s not at all certain how her childhood recording was rediscovered. Satellite radio, she speculated, or perhaps the internet. But here\\'s what she knows for sure: \"I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas\" — which peaked 63 years ago at No. 24 on the Billboard chart — has become a viral sensation. (A video of Ms. Peevey\\'s \"Toast of the Town\" appearance — she\\'s in a party frock and hair ribbon and halts a game of jacks with her playmates to belt out her singular wish — has had more than four million views on YouTube recent comments include, \"This song is stuck in my head. \") But the people at the Postal Service were not the first to harness the power of the song. In 2008, Hallmark came out with a tree ornament that plays the earworm of a tune, written by the songwriter John Rox. (His other hit was \"It\\'s a Big, Wide Wonderful World,\" recorded in 1949 by Buddy Clark.) Hallmark has brought the ornament back four more times, including during the 2016 holiday season. Look for it again next year. Gretchen Wilson, a country music singer, recorded the song on a Christmas album that was released in 2009. LeAnn Rimes, another country singer, followed suit in 2014, but said she could never hope to equal Ms. Peevey\\'s inimitable sound. Thanks to the resurgence in the song\\'s popularity, Ms. Peevey — who goes by the surname Henderson except for matters — has been deluged with calls and emails from newspapers, television stations and fans all over the world. Royalty checks in amounts ranging from a few hundred dollars to $1, 000 have been rolling in — more about this in a minute. \"It\\'s like a whole new world,\" she said. Actually, it\\'s something of a return to the world Ms. Peevey inhabited as a cute, blond from Oklahoma City. After her record took off, going out in public became an impossibility. \"It was crazy,\" she remembered. \"People were looking and pointing. I got mobbed everywhere I went. \" Ms. Peevey said she started singing \"practically out of the womb. \" \"I can\\'t remember when I didn\\'t sing,\" she continued. \"I really can\\'t. \" From an early age, she was a mainstay of the church choir in Ponca City, Okla. where her family moved in 1948. There she put on backyard shows for the neighbors and sang at community events. Her robust voice with its country sheen was a force of nature. An uncle who played fiddle on a radio show broadcast from Oklahoma City arranged a guest spot for Gayla when she was 8 it led first to a gig on (now KFOR) the local NBC affiliate, then to a regular spot on \"Saturday Night Revue,\" an NBC variety show that was a summer replacement for \"Your Show of Shows. \" Hoagy Carmichael was the host. \"I sang duets with him,\" Ms. Peevey recalled. \"There was one of his songs, \\'Two Sleepy People,\\' and I sang harmony — it was very fun. \" Guest stars included Jimmy Durante and Dean Martin, with whom Ms. Peevey performed during her first appearance on the program. And every week the show booked a different big orchestra, \"so I got to sing with Les Brown and Jerry Fielding and David Rose,\" she said. \"Plucked out of local television — it was a big jump. But they were so nice to me because I was a kid. \" Then came the contract from Columbia Records. The very first song that Mitch Miller, then a Columbia executive, brought to Ms. Peevey was \"I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas. \" She recorded it in New York with Mr. Miller playing the oboe and leading the orchestra. \"I didn\\'t have to sing it that many times,\" she recalled. \"I would say the third time was the take. \" She introduced the song on \"Toast of the Town,\" though not without considerable drama beforehand: Her manager canceled an exclusive contract with NBC so that she could appear on the rival network CBS, home of Mr. Sullivan\\'s show — \"and I didn\\'t get another NBC contract after that,\" Ms. Peevey said. \"I don\\'t know if the manager made the best decision, but everybody watched Ed Sullivan,\" she said. \"The record took off and was a big hit. \" In a media event at the end of 1953, a real, live hippopotamus from the Central Park Zoo was shipped to Oklahoma City as a Christmas present for young Gayla she donated it to her local zoo. At the time, Ms. Peevey said, \"there was talk that my career was going to be huge. \" But things didn\\'t turn out that way, and the producers at Columbia Records may have been part of the problem. \"After the hippo song, they thought, \\'Well, that was a big hit,\\' so every song they gave me after that was an animal song and they were not good songs, let me tell you,\" Ms. Peevey said. She was occasionally teamed with a fellow child star, Jimmy Boyd, singer of the \"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus. \" \"My parents didn\\'t know that they could speak up and say, \\'Is this really the best song? \\'\" she continued. \"In Oklahoma, I was used to singing \\'Your Cheatin\\' Heart\\' and \\'Walkin\\' My Baby Back Home\\' and all of those adult songs that I could really sink my teeth into. \" Ms. Peevey\\'s father, Lewin, a tax collector, and her mother, Irene, a homemaker, were the antithesis of stage parents, not particularly keen on show business and uncertain about how to deal with Gayla\\'s sudden fame. \"They decided that they wanted to take me out of show business so I could have a normal life,\" she said. \"They pulled the plug, and I was a kid so I didn\\'t have any say. \" But Ms. Peevey said she was \"kind of happy\" to get away from all the hubbub. Part of pulling the plug involved a move to Southern California, where she was just another student at the local junior high school. \"What a shock it was,\" Ms. Peevey remembered. \"Nobody knew who I was, and I realized I was lacking some basic social skills that I hadn\\'t had to develop. \" \"I was so used to everybody clamoring for me and coming to me,\" she explained. \"I didn\\'t have a lot of experience in reaching out and being a friend. I had a big learning curve in that regard. \" But that was not the only adjustment. To retire as a child star packs a particularly unpleasant wallop. \"You have this sort of feeling that you\\'re a at 12,\" Ms. Peevey said. \"That was the thing I had to deal with — that I had already peaked. \" She had a bit of a comeback at 16 when \"My Little Marine,\" a song she wrote and recorded under the name Jamie Horton, made it into the top 100 on Billboard. Another tune, \"Robot Man,\" \"did pretty well, but nothing took off as it did when I was a child,\" Ms. Peevey said. \"I can see where child stars get into trouble as far as not being able to negotiate the transition to adult performer, and it can be very devastating if you\\'re not grounded. \" After getting a degree in elementary education, she briefly taught school in San Diego. \"But it wasn\\'t for me,\" Ms. Peevey said. Instead, she opened a small advertising business while raising her daughter, Sydney, who inherited Mom\\'s musical chops. It was Sydney who did a little research three years ago and learned that Ms. Peevey had an account at Sony Music, now the parent company of Columbia. \"They were holding funds of just under a hundred grand that had been adding up since 2008,\" Ms. Peevey said. \"I couldn\\'t believe it. It\\'s pretty fun. \" She also has royalties coming in from sales of \"I Want a Hippopotamus\" on iTunes. \"I thought my life as a was going to be all about playing with my grandchildren,\" Ms. Peevey said. \"But for people to have all this interest in me has opened things up for me — I\\'ve retired, but my song hasn\\'t. \"', 'The American Civil Liberties Union is launching what it bills as the first grassroots mobilization effort in its nearly 100-year history, as it seeks to harness a surge of energy among left-leaning activists since the November election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president. The campaign, known as PeoplePower, kicks off on Saturday with a town hall-style event in Miami featuring \"resistance training\" that will be streamed live at more than 2,300 local gatherings nationwide. It will focus on free speech, reproductive rights and immigration and include presentations from legal experts, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero and \"Top Chef\" television star Padma Lakshmi. Membership in the civil rights organization, which was founded in 1920, has tripled to more than 1 million since Trump\\'s election, the group says. As activists have marched in streets, demonstrated at airports and confronted U.S. lawmakers regularly since election day, progressive groups like MoveOn and the newly formed Indivisible have sought ways to translate that frustration into local action. That is the idea behind PeoplePower, which represents a major strategic shift for an organization that has traditionally focused on courtroom litigation, Romero said in a phone interview on Friday. Approximately 135,000 people have signed up for the campaign. \"Before, our membership was largely older and much smaller,\" he said. \"Our members would provide us with money so we could file the cases and do the advocacy. What\\'s clear with the Trump election is that our new members are engaged and want to be deployed.\" For example, the Miami event will encourage individuals to engage local officials in conversations about immigrant policies in their town or city. The ACLU has prepared \"model\" ordinances ensuring the protection of immigrant rights that supporters can press legislators to adopt, part of a campaign to create \"freedom cities,\" according to ACLU political director Faiz Shakir. Suggested tactics, like the use of text messages as a mass mobilization tool, will mirror some of those employed by the insurgent presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who mounted a surprisingly robust challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. \"It\\'s completely unprecedented,\" Romero said of the response since Trump\\'s victory. \"People are wide awake right now and have been since the night of the election.\"', 'The House Select Committee on Benghazi released its report on Tuesday detailing the attacks in Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The committee found no evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state. Here is a selection of summarized findings in the report, with fact checks: This criticism is not particularly new. Senior Pentagon officials have consistently said that they were constrained by the \"tyranny of time and distance\" — that is, that the military could not have sent troops or planes in time to have made a difference. The report and Republican critics have always countered that had the White House and Pentagon acted more swiftly, they might have mitigated the later attack on the compound\\'s C. I. A. annex. But it is unclear what forces might have made a difference there. _____ This sounds like dithering that might have cost American lives. But the uniform swaps reflect the chaos and confusion in sorting out what was going on in Benghazi, and whether American forces should arrive identifiable as United States military personnel or be less noticeable in civilian clothes. Even the report acknowledges the challenges facing the FAST teams: These troops did not have their own planes, which meant delays waiting for flights did not travel with their own vehicles (they would need to find some in Benghazi when they landed) and were designed to deploy before a crisis hit, not during hostilities. _____ This suggests that the Obama administration was not treating the crisis seriously. But the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr. was not a critical player in the drama. He was only one of many senior officials involved in managing the crisis, and was briefed after his dinner. There were many other senior White House, State Department and Pentagon officials, both in Washington and overseas, dealing with the crisis throughout the night. An independent inquiry in December 2012, among others, came to a similar conclusion. That report faulted State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests from the American Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, for more guards at the Benghazi mission and for failing to make sufficient safety upgrades. As security in Libya worsened in the summer of 2012, the State Department remained committed to a security strategy to deploy a modest American security force and then increasingly rely on trained Libyan personnel to protect American diplomats. That strategy, which had been set a year earlier after the fall of Col. Muammar \\'s government, failed. Warning signs were indeed flashing red for months before the attack. The Obama administration received intelligence reports that Islamic extremist groups were operating training camps in the mountains near Benghazi. By June, the city had experienced a string of assassinations, as well as attacks on the Red Cross and on a British envoy\\'s motorcade. Mr. Stevens emailed his superiors in Washington in August, alerting them to \"a security vacuum\" in the city.', 'Is Audrey Hepburn making a return to the house of Givenchy? On Thursday, the French brand named Clare Waight Keller as its artistic director, responsible for women\\'s and men\\'s wear, accessories and couture. She will be the first woman to run the creative side of the house founded by Hubert de Givenchy in 1952. The announcement marks a new stage in this year\\'s game of fashion musical chairs, and it is a potentially significant change, both for Givenchy and its incoming designer. The news came less than two months after Ms. Waight Keller, a British designer, officially resigned from Chloé — which is owned by Compagnie Financière Richemont, and which announced last week that its new creative director was Natacha . Ms. had been creative director of women\\'s at Louis Vuitton, a brand that, like Givenchy, is owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. \"I am very happy to have Clare Waight Keller join the LVMH group,\" said Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, in announcing the news, which was released simultaneously on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WeChat and Weibo. \"I believe her widespread expertise and vision will allow Givenchy to enter the next phase of its unique path. \" What that next phase is remains to be seen, but the choice of Ms. Waight Keller, rumored during the recent Paris Fashion Week, suggests the answer is not more of the same. Givenchy\\'s previous artistic director, Riccardo Tisci, left the brand in February after 12 years. He was responsible for transforming it from the house defined largely by the relationship between Mr. de Givenchy and Ms. Hepburn, his greatest muse, to a house the Kardashians loved, with all the Gothic buzz that suggests. Mr. Tisci also made it a social media force. By contrast, there is nothing about Ms. Waight Keller, 46, a personality often pictured peeking out from under her long brown hair, hands tucked into trouser pockets. As a designer, she has seemed content to let her brands be the stars, and her work, both at Chloé and in her former position as designer of Pringle of Scotland, was marked by a accessible elegance with a tailored line. Think of it as slouchy chic. Indeed, the statement by Philippe Fortunato, chief executive of Givenchy, seemed to suggest a return to the brand\\'s roots. \"I am very excited to see Clare bring her singular sense of elegance and modernity to Givenchy,\" he said. \"By exploring our maison\\'s heritage and the outstanding of its ateliers, I am convinced Clare will help Givenchy reach its full potential. \" Though Ms. Waight Keller, who began her career working at Calvin Klein in New York and with Tom Ford at Gucci, was also in charge of men\\'s wear at Pringle, she has never worked with an haute couture atelier before. Givenchy suspended its formal couture shows in 2012, first holding static presentations of the collection instead, and more recently incorporating some couture looks into its men\\'s wear shows in January and June. But the fact that Ms. Waight Keller has been specifically given responsibility for the highest form of fashion\\'s art suggests that a return to a more formal couture offering may be in the future. It also suggests that the idea was false that Ms. Waight Keller, who has three children and has recently moved her family to London from Paris, was taking time off after Chloé because of the pressures of today\\'s fashion cycle. Her responsibilities at Givenchy, after all, will be significantly greater than her responsibilities at Chloé: She will be overseeing at least eight collections a year, as opposed to four. LVMH does not break down the performance of individual brands in its financial results, but the Givenchy annual sales revenue is believed to be to around 500 million euros, or more than $530 million,) and there are 72 stores worldwide. In January, LVMH reported revenue of €37. 6 billion in 2016, an increase of 5 percent, beating expectations because of strong sales in the United States and Europe, and a pickup in demand in Asia. Along with the move of Raf Simons to Calvin Klein from Christian Dior, the switch by Ms. Waight Keller should put to rest the recent theory that designers are rebelling against the relentless demands of the system by stepping off the hamster wheel. Perhaps most significantly of all, though, her appointment at the helm of one of LVMH\\'s signature brands is further indication that the largest luxury group in the world is increasingly focused on the talents of women designers, and changing a historical pattern that has seen most large brands with significant women\\'s wear profiles run by male creatives. (In June, Christian Dior, the structural owner of LVMH, named Maria Grazia Chiuri as artistic director.) In her new role — like Phoebe Philo, the creative director of Céline, another LVMH brand (who, when she was creative director of Chloé, became the first designer to ever take a formal maternity leave) — Ms. Waight Keller will move between London and Paris, where the Givenchy atelier is based. It may seem astonishing, but the idea that a designer would not have to choose between having a power position and a family life is a relatively new look in the fashion world. Ms. Waight Keller officially begins work May 2. Her first show for Givenchy will take place during Paris Fashion Week in October. The fashion world will be left to speculate on where Mr. Tisci, whose next move has not yet been announced, will end up. Rumor has it the answer is Versace. Stay tuned.', 'Yemen s ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh has had a successful operation at a Sanaa hospital after a Russian medical team was flown in to perform it, government sources said on Saturday. The Russian team arrived in Sanaa two days ago and operated on Saleh on Friday for wounds he sustained in an assassination attempt in 2011. Saleh s General People s Congress Party said the procedure was successful, and that his condition was stable. Saleh was severely wounded in an attack on the presidential palace in Sanaa in June 2011. He went to the United States for treatment on one occasion, before a travel ban was imposed. The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Saleh in 2014, accusing him of threatening peace and obstructing Yemen s political process, subjecting him to a global travel ban and an asset freeze. Government sources told Reuters the Russian team had arrived with approval from the Saudi-led Arab alliance but did not reveal the precise nature of the surgery. Saleh ruled Yemen for 34 years, but was forced from power after pro-democracy protests in 2012. Forming a surprise alliance with the Houthi movement when they seized Sanaa in 2014, Saleh s army loyalists and Houthi fighters have weathered thousands of air strikes by the Saudi-led military coalition in more than two years of war.', 'Republican Senator Charles Grassley wants answers on why the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. was allowed in the US after her visa had been denied. Grassley, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on Fox & Friends that she magically appeared in the US. Grassley has written to the Secretary of State and DHS Secretary in an effort to get to the bottom of this mystery.The second curious connection is that the DNC opposition research firm, Fusion GPS, is connected to the Russian Lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Remember that Fusion GPS is responsible for the Trump-Russia Dossier that made scurrilous claims against President Trump including the golden showers incident:Circa News Reports: Fusion has been a major focal point of the FBI and Congress because it hired a former British intelligence agent named Christopher Steele to produce a salacious intelligence dossier that made wild and still unsubstantiated claims about Trump ties to Russia.Does anyone else find it curious that this woman claimed to have dirt on Clinton but never produced a thing. Was she told to just say that to get Donald Jr. to meet with her in a set up?

This collection of free-thinkers have upturned the traditional Western political paradigm and hopes to use online public polls to shape governmental policy and end all Internet spying. Although the Pirate Party formed just four years ago, its popularity has skyrocketed — most likely for unconventional tactics aligning loosely with libertarianism — the promotion of privacy rights and personal freedoms, and simultaneous shrinking of Big Government. Edward Snowden has been offered the safe haven of Icelandic citizenship should the Pirates likely victory come to fruition — which makes sense, given the party\\'s anti-establishment roots. In fact, the Pirates have experienced astonishing success in a short time — taking the nation\\'s longstanding political traditionalists off-guard in the process — even the group\\'s founder, a programmer and former Wikileaks activist, is stunned. Asked whether she expected the explosion of enthusiasm for the nascent Pirate Party — which now leads in public polls with 22.6 percent — founder Birgitta Jónsdóttir decisively told the Washington Post , \"No way.\" But considering growing frustration with ever-increasing Western governments — and all of the surveillance programs, police state tactics, and chill on personal liberties — the rise of the Pirates, who describe themselves as neither right nor left but a radical mix of both, hardly seems too shocking. \"People want real changes and they understand that we have to change the systems,\" Jónsdóttir asserted, \"we have to modernize how we make laws.\" According to the Pirates\\' website , \"The Icelandic Pirate Party was founded on November 24th, 2012 based on the political ideology of the Swedish Pirate Party, which Richard Falkvinge founded in January 2006, to bring about internet copyright reform.\"', 'Donald Trump pretty much goes ballistic anytime someone says something bad about his precious Trump University, a failed real estate investment seminar that is now facing multiple class-action lawsuits from approximately 5,000 attendees, calling the school out for being a scam.On Monday, the Republican front runner took his characteristic bullying to a new level when he released a video in which he threatened the victims behind the fraud charges. In the video, Trump creepily sits alone in a dark room for three minutes and defends his beloved university despite the fact that even he himself has admitted that it was a scam.Specifically calling out two former attendees of the University who have publicly stated that they were ripped off, the business mogul made a disturbing threat that shows just how shady he is when it comes to his business endeavors: cross me and I will name you so my insane Twitter followers can harass you.Trump went as far as to hold up supposed positive evaluation forms from the two fraud victims named in the video, stating that their forms would be used in court. He said, When they are on the stand, they will be shown and shown [sic] these reports. Why would anybody settle a case when we have reports like this? I just can t do it. Trump s message gets even weirder when he compares his battle against the fraud charges to America, although it s not really clear what the hell he means. Trump said: And you know what? The United States should fight back also. We shouldn t just be settlers, we should fight back. And do what s right. You can watch Trump s message below:The victims Trump speaks of have both appeared in ads paid for by the American Future Fund, a nonprofit conservative group with connection to the billionaire Koch brothers. In those ads, the victims describe how they spend over $30,000 for seminars at Trump University, and did not get any of the education the university promised them. One of the men said in the ad: Trump University ruined my credit, and it ruined my life. And now by naming and exposing this attendee to all of his Twitter followers, Trump has ruined his life once again and couldn t care less.

The role got a higher profile on Monday night when the Republican president promptly fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to enforce his executive order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. Yates was a holdover from the Obama administration. Sessions, a 70-year-old senator from Alabama and a close Trump ally since the early days of his presidential campaign, was likely to support the executive order. One of his former staffers, Stephen Miller, helped shape the document from the White House. Sessions\\' allegiance to Trump, his hard-line immigration positions and civil rights record came under scrutiny during his 10-1/2-hour hearing before the committee on Jan. 10. Trump\\'s Justice Department is likely to operate in sharp contrast to the agency under Obama. Civil rights groups say the choices Trump has made in his appointments to leadership roles at the department show that the agency is preparing to neglect or even weaken civil rights protections. Hours after Trump\\'s inauguration, the administration appointed Thomas Wheeler and John Gore to serve as interim leaders in the department\\'s Civil Rights Division. Wheeler, the current acting head of the division, defended in private practice a school that confiscated a student\\'s breast cancer awareness bracelet for being \"inappropriate;\" a public school that held a Christmas show in which Bible excerpts were read and religious songs were sung; and the Walgreens drugstore chain in a case in which a pharmacist looked up the birth control records of a customer and shared them with the customer\\'s ex-boyfriend. Gore, who will serve as deputy assistant attorney general in charge of voting rights and employment litigation, helped defend state election redistricting plans that were challenged on grounds that they violated the Voting Rights Act.', 'Real \"patriots,\" the Bundys claim, stand against a behemoth government that has grasped their lands and their rights. America, after all, is made by ambitious individuals working their way up. A government that promotes social welfare or regulates business destroys the American system because it both limits a man\\'s ability to make money and requires tax revenue. Those taxes strike at the very heart of individualism because they redistribute money from hard workers to lazy people. Ammon and Ryan Bundy and their compatriots are quite clear about exactly who those lazy people are. The younger Bundys\\' father, Cliven, the Nevada rancher who started an armed standoff with government officials in 2014 over grazing rights, had plenty to say about the \"Negro\" who lived in government housing and \"didn\\'t have nothing to do.\" African-Americans\\' laziness led them to abort their children and send their young men to jail. Bundy wondered: \"are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life… or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn\\'t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\" And yet, the Bundys are perfectly comfortably taking money from government programs themselves. Aside from animal kill programs that protect herds, drought relief payments, and the 93 percent discount at which the government assesses grazing fees, Ammon Bundy borrowed more than $500,000 from the federal government through a loan guarantee program for small businesses. Ammon Bundy\\'s father, Cliven, owes the government more than $1 million in grazing fees for running his cattle on public land. No matter how you slice it, taxpayers have subsidized the Bundys. Observers have made much of this obvious contradiction. But it is not a sign only of the Bundys\\' lack of self-awareness, or even simply of white supremacy. It is the intellectual formula that has driven American politics since 1980. That formula was laid down immediately after the Civil War. In 1865, the South was so devastated by the war that Southerners, white and black, were starving. To provide rations and medical care, and to place homeless Southerners on farming land, Congress created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. To emphasize that government aid would be temporary, they placed what became known as the Freedmen\\'s Bureau within the War Department. In summer 1865, military officers distributed 150,000 rations, a third of them to white people. But the agents also took on an unexpected role. Southern states refused to let ex-slaves testify in court, leaving them to the tender mercies of angry white Southerners, who cheated, beat, raped and murdered them. So Freedmen\\'s Bureau officers began to hear the cases that pitted black and white Southerners against each other. While agents often forced black people back to work for abusive employers or demanded subservient behavior, they decided cases in favor of ex-slaves about 68 percent of the time. So Southern Democrats rewrote history. They had not fought the Civil War over slavery after all, they insisted. They had fought it to stop a huge government bureaucracy from forcing its way into their homes and regulating the way they treated \"their people.\" They had fought, they now claimed, not for slavery, but for states\\' rights. When Congress tried to expand the Freedmen\\'s Bureau the following year to enable it to provide education for poor Americans of all races, President Andrew Johnson added the final ideological piece to the Democrats\\' attack on an activist government. That piece was taxation. During the war, the Republican Congress had created the nation\\'s first national taxes, including the income tax. Johnson vetoed the bill expanding the Freedmen\\'s Bureau on two grounds. First, although the schools in the bill would have disproportionately helped whites in the border states, Johnson claimed that it provided benefits for African-Americans that had never been accorded to white people. Second, he explained that the bill would create an army of officials that would harass Southern whites, while the taxes necessary to support them would impoverish hardworking white people. This formula—that an activist government sucks white tax dollars to provide for lazy minorities—has been sold to voters ever since. It caught on largely because of the odd happenstance that it coincided with the rise of the American cowboy. During this very moment, the cattle industry was taking off on the Western plains. Cowboys tended to be former Confederates who were dirt poor and good with a horse and a gun. Their dirty, hard, ill-paid and dangerous lives mirrored those of Eastern industrial workers, but Southern Democratic newspaper editors grabbed hold of the idea of the free and independent cowboy as the embodiment of American individualism. Cowboys, they said, were the very opposite of the ex-slaves the government was coddling. Cowboys were hardworking young men who asked nothing of the government. The reality, of course, was that the cattle industry depended almost entirely on the American government. The Army protected herds and cattlemen against Indians, Congress funded the railroads that moved cattle to Eastern markets, and Indian agents bought cattle to fulfill the ration provisions of treaties. Cattlemen, in short, received massive government subsidies. But the image of the Western cowboy as a hardworking man who asked only to be left alone got traction among Southerners and Northern Democrats who hated the idea of black rights, and who loathed the Republicans\\' activist government that was trying to enforce those rights. By the 1870s, ex-Confederates had taken their support for Western individualism a step further. They insisted the federal government was actively persecuting Western individuals. Their hero was Jesse James, the former Confederate guerilla-turned-criminal. When a Republican state government in Missouri refused to let ex-Confederates sit on juries or practice law, Democrats used the fugitive James to bludgeon their political opponents. James was \"an angel of light,\" as one said, who wanted to turn himself in to authorities, but could not because he would not get a fair trial in a courtroom full of his political opponents. He was a good man, the story went, but the government was forcing him into criminality. And then, the governor of Missouri cut a deal with Robert Ford to kill James. That a government official had colluded to murder a citizen added fuel to the idea that Westerners were in danger from an overweening government. The political construct that lionized Western individuals and demonized an activist government, a government that apparently helped minorities, was a product of a peculiar moment in American history. Neither the moment nor the ideology lasted. The political construct that idealized cowboys fell into disrepute during and immediately after the New Deal. In those years, Americans turned away from Western individualism and toward the idea of an activist government. Westerners and Southerners both, after all, were suffering from the Dust Bowl and the boll weevil. They wanted government programs even more than Easterners did. But in the 1950s, the Movement Conservative war on the New Deal resurrected the post-Civil War political cliché. Since the Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954, Movement Conservatives have tapped into the idea that an activist government redistributed wealth to lazy minorities. But they have also pushed hard on the idea that true Americans are Western individualists. Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater launched this association in 1964 by dismissing Brown v. Board as governmental overreach and fictionalizing his wealthy upbringing as a hardscrabble Western frontier story; Ronald Reagan made it even more explicit by contrasting his image of the Welfare Queen with his own cowboy hat and Western ranch. And yet, the Goldwater and the Reagan stories mirrored those of the historical Western individual: their regions, and their own families, prospered only when government contracts poured money into their communities. To them, there was no contradiction between their championing of individualism and benefiting from government largess. According to Movement Conservatives, Americans who believe in individualism want nothing from the government, and thus, unlike grasping minorities, they are the nation\\'s true patriots. The government should do nothing for \"lazy black Americans,\" who only want an un-American redistribution of wealth through taxes. But, paradoxically, the government can—and should—use tax money to help America\\'s individualists. This is the peculiar contradiction that defines today\\'s politics. Confederates, cowboys, anti-government diatribes from people who are prime beneficiaries of government programs … thanks to the Bundys we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of Reconstruction by reliving it.', 'Chance events play a much larger role in life than many people once imagined. Most of us have no difficulty recognizing luck when it\\'s on conspicuous display, as when someone wins the lottery. But randomness often plays out in subtle ways, and it\\'s easy to construct narratives that portray success as having been inevitable. Those stories are almost invariably misleading, however, a simple fact that has surprising implications for public policy. Consider the history of the Mona Lisa, perhaps the most famous painting in the world. After having languished in obscurity for most of its early existence, Leonardo da Vinci\\'s work was pushed into the spotlight in 1911 when it was stolen from the Louvre. The widely publicized theft remained unsolved for two years until Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian maintenance worker at the Louvre, was apprehended after trying to sell the painting to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. His arrest provoked a second wave of publicity, with images of the Mona Lisa splashed around the world. In the years since, the painting has come to represent Western culture itself. Yet had it never been stolen, most of us would know no more about it than we do of the two obscure Leonardo da Vinci canvases from the same period that hang in an adjacent gallery at the Louvre. Like Kim Kardashian, apparently, the Mona Lisa is famous largely for being famous. As in the art world, so too in the world of work. Almost every career trajectory entails a complex sequence of steps, each of which depends on those preceding it. If any of those earlier steps had been different, the entire trajectory would almost surely have been different, too. Inevitably, some of those initial steps will have been influenced by seemingly trivial random events. So it is reasonable to conclude that virtually all successful careers entail at least a modicum of luck. One\\'s date of birth can matter enormously, for example. According to a 2008 study, most children born in the summer tend to be among the youngest members of their class at school, which appears to explain why they are significantly less likely to hold leadership positions during high school and thus, another study indicates, less likely to land premium jobs later in life. Similarly, according to research published in the journal Economics Letters in 2012, the number of American chief executives who were born in June and July is almost lower than would be expected on the basis of chance alone. Even the first letter of a person\\'s last name can explain significant achievement gaps. Assistant professors in the 10 American economics departments, for instance, were more likely to be promoted to tenure the earlier the first letter of their last names fell in the alphabet, a 2006 study found. Researchers attributed this to the custom in economics of listing \\' names alphabetically on papers, noting that no similar effect existed for professors in psychology, whose names are not listed alphabetically. To acknowledge the importance of random events is not to suggest that success is independent of talent and effort. In highly competitive arenas, those who do well are almost always extremely talented and . As Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Warren E. Buffett\\'s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has said, \"The safest way to get what you want is to try and deserve what you want. \" Perhaps the most useful advice for someone who aspires to material success is to develop expertise at a task that others value. Such expertise comes not from luck but from thousands of hours of assiduous effort. But talent and effort are not enough. Luck also matters. Even the most able, industrious people in South Sudan have little chance at success. Success is not guaranteed for deserving people in wealthy countries with highly developed legal and educational institutions and other infrastructure, but it\\'s substantially more likely. Being born in a good environment is one of the few dimensions of luck we can control — that is, at least we can decide how lucky our children will be. But as a nation, we\\'ve been doing a bad job of it for at least a generation. The luckiest are getting luckier even as their numbers shrink. The unlucky population is growing, and its luck is getting worse. These changes have stemmed in part from sharply diminished public support for education. According to a 2015 report by the nonpartisan Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, for example, state spending per student averaged about 20 percent less in than in the school year. More than 70 percent of students who graduated from colleges in 2015 had student loans that averaged $35, 000. It\\'s no surprise, then, that access to the benefits of a college degree continues to depend heavily on family income. According to a study from the Alliance for Higher Education and Democracy, at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education, 77 percent of offspring of families in the top income quartile had earned college degrees by age 24 in 2013, compared with only 9 percent of those from families. More troubling, the disparity persists even when controlling for precollege academic aptitude scores. The human tendency to underestimate luck\\'s role has contributed to this troubling state of affairs by reducing the electorate\\'s willingness to support the public investments that make economic success possible. But the taxes people want to avoid need not be personally painful. Evidence from the social sciences demonstrates that beyond a certain income threshold, people\\'s sense of depends much more on their relative purchasing power than on how much they spend in absolute terms. If top tax rates were a little higher, all homes would be a little smaller, all cars a little less expensive, all diamonds a little more modest and all celebrations a little less costly. The standards that define \"special\" would adjust accordingly, leaving most successful people quite satisfied. Happily, there is a simple remedy: Merely prompting people to reflect on their good fortune tends to make them more willing to contribute to the common good, according to a 2010 study published in the journal Emotion. So try to engage your successful friends in discussions about their experiences with luck. In the process, you may increase their willingness to support the kinds of public investments that will enhance the next generation\\'s odds of success. And you will almost surely hear some interesting stories.', 'Any escalation of tension on the Korean peninsula is unacceptable, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that only one thing will work in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind. Lavrov underlined the inadmissibility of any escalation of tension on the Korean peninsula, to which the USA s military preparations lead, and called for contradictions to be resolved by diplomatic means only, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Lavrov also demanded the return of Russian diplomatic property seized by the United States in 2016 when former U.S. president Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and ordered that some of its U.S. diplomatic properties be vacated. The Obama administration said it was retaliating for Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election. In July, Moscow responded, ordering the United States to cut the number of its diplomatic and technical staff working in Russia by around 60 percent, to 455. Russia reserves the right to go to court and to (take) retaliatory measures, Lavrov told Tillerson. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month the foreign ministry would go to court to see just how efficient the much-praised U.S. judiciary is . Lavrov and Tillerson discussed the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, the ministry said. Lavrov said a Kiev-backed draft law aiming at reintegration of Ukraine s Donbass region, which is controlled by Russian-backed separatists, contradicts the Minsk peace agreements aimed at resolving the conflict. The draft law would declare separatist-controlled regions to be occupied , allowing Kiev to use military troops in those territories. The ministry said the Russian and U.S. sides had agreed to continue a dialogue on the difficult issues between Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon.', 'There is no word yet about whether or not the Hispanics in question were referred to by the plaintiff as White Hispanics, (the George Zimmerman variety) Legendary restaurant Roscoe s House of Chicken n Waffles has to cough up $1.6 million in an unlawful termination suit to an African American man who claimed he was discriminated against because he was black.The claim proves to be somewhat ironic given that the owner of the eatery, where President Barack Obama once dined when visiting Compton, is African American.CBS Los Angeles reported that Daniel Beasley sued Roscoe s for firing him after he complained to human resources that the managers harassed him for being black and gave preferential treatment, such as better work hours, to the Hispanic employees. It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it, Beasley told reporters. It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley was frustrated that his complaints to management never got addressed, so he sued. It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it, he told reporters. It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley explained to CBS that he became homeless after he lost his job, so the hefty settlement becomes a huge victory for the grandfather from Compton.His lawyer Scott Cummings hopes that this win sends a message to other businesses out there. Racism, racial harassment can occur really anywhere even in a black-owned business, he asserted. Beasley added, You can t treat people like that and get away with it constantly.', 'November 19, 2016 Speculation: Trump Promotes NSA Boss Rogers To DNI Because He Leaked The Clinton Emails  If some investigative journos start digging into the issue this story could develop into a really interesting scandal:  Pentagon and intelligence community chiefs have urged Obama to remove the head of the NSA The heads of the Pentagon and the nation\\'s intelligence community have recommended to President Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, be removed.  The recommendation, delivered to the White House last month, was made by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to several U.S. officials familiar with the matter. ... The news comes as Rogers is being considered by President-Elect Donald Trump to be his nominee for DNI, replacing Clapper as the official who oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. In a move apparently unprecedented for a military officer, Rogers, without notifying superiors, traveled to New York to meet with Trump on Thursday at Trump Tower.  Adm. Michael S. Rogers recently claimed in reference to the hack of the Democratic National Council emails that Wikileaks spreading them is \"a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.\" He obviously meant Russia.  Compare that with his boss James Clapper who very recently said (again) that the \"intelligence agencies don\\'t have good insight on when or how Wikileaks obtained the hacked emails.\"  Emails of the DNC and of Clinton\\'s consigliere John Podesta were hacked and leaked. Additionally emails from Clinton\\'s private email server were released. All these influenced the election in favor of Trump.  Wikileaks boss Assange says he does not know where the emails come from but he does not think they came from Russia.  Clapper and Carter wanted Rogers fired because he was generally disliked at the NSA, because two big breaches in the most secret Tailored Access Organization occurred on his watch even after the Snowden case and because he blocked, with the help of Senator McCain, plans to split the NSA into a spying and a cyber war unit.  Now let me spin this a bit.  Rogers obviously knew he was on the to-be-fired list and he had good relations with the Republicans.  Now follows speculation:  Some Rogers trusted dudes at the NSA (or in the Navy cyber arm which Rogers earlier led) hack into the DNC, Podesta emails and the Clinton private email server. An easy job with the tools the NSA provides for its spies. Whoever hacked the emails then pushes what they got to Wikileaks (and DCleaks , another \"leak\" outlet). Wikileaks publishes what it gets because that is what it usually does. Assange also has various reasons to hate Clinton. She was always very hostile to Wikileaks. She allegedly even mused of killing Assange by a drone strike.  Rogers then accuses Russia of the breach even while the rest of the spying community finds no evidence for such a claim. That is natural to do for a military man who grew up during the cold war and may wish that war (and its budgets) back. It is also a red herring that will never be proven wrong or right unless the original culprit is somehow found.  Next we know - Trump offers Rogers the Clapper job. He would replace the boss that wanted him fired.  Rogers support for the new cold war will also gain him favor with the various weapon industries which will eventually beef up his pension.  Some of the above is speculation. But it would make sense and explain the quite one-sided wave of leaks we saw during this election cycle.  Even if it isn\\'t true it would at least be a good script for a Hollywood movie on the nastiness of the inside fighting in Washington DC.  Let me know how plausible you find the tale. 19, 2016 at 02:14 PM | Permalink', 'The Philadelphia sound will sound again. The Philadelphia Orchestra ended a brief strike on Sunday, two days after its musicians sent a shock wave through the classical music world by walking off the job just before a gala. The players went on strike Friday to protest a contract offer that they said did not do enough to restore the pay and benefits lost amid the orchestra\\'s bankruptcy, which ended a little over four years ago. But after returning to the bargaining table with a mediator on Saturday, the musicians and management agreed early on Sunday to a contract that included a 2 percent raise in the first year and raises of 2½ percent in the second and third years. The contract will bring the players\\' base pay to $137, 800 by the final year, the orchestra said, though many players make more. As part of the contract deal, the orchestra said, the musicians agreed to play more Sunday concerts and to give management more flexibility to stage concerts. The musicians, who had planned to picket on Sunday, instead met to ratify the deal. \"There is some grave disappointment that the offer does not get us to where we need to be,\" John Koen, a cellist who is chairman of the musicians\\' negotiating committee, said. At the same time, he said, the final deal was an improvement over management\\'s original offer, and the players were eager to return to work. \"We wanted to avoid harming the institution. \" Crucial committees of the orchestra\\'s board of directors voted unanimously to recommend the contract to the full board, which is expected to vote on it Tuesday. Allison Vulgamore, the orchestra\\'s chief executive, said in a statement, \"We now have a tentative agreement that will immediately restore our music to our audiences and provide our outstanding musicians with a compensation plan that both increases their base salaries and provides additional financial reward as we continue to build resources for a vibrant and exciting future. \" The agreement would also increase the orchestra\\'s size. Though the Philadelphia Orchestra historically had 105 musicians, it imposed a hiring freeze during the bankruptcy that initially held that number at 95, and then 96. The new contract calls for hiring a 97th player in the third year. The orchestra\\'s season will resume on Thursday in Philadelphia, when Simon Rattle will conduct Mahler\\'s Symphony No. 6 in a program that the orchestra, known for its plush sound, will repeat on Oct. 10 at Carnegie Hall. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, which also walked out Friday, remained on strike Sunday.', 'October 26, 2016 \"Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\" ~ Georgia Guidestones  This is one of the first of ten commandments blazoned across the Georgia Guidestones, an occult monument for which no person or organization has taken credit. Though the monument was commissioned by someone named R.C. Christian more than two decades ago, the true identity of the person who built this specter is still unidentified, and the message is but one of the many examples of a cabalistic desire to cull the population.  There are many more \\'hidden\\' in plain sight.  The Georgie Guidestones state : 1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. 2. Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity. 3. Unite humanity with a living new language. 4. Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason. 5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts. 6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court. 7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials. 8. Balance personal rights with social duties. 9. Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite. 10.Be not a cancer on the earth – Leave room for nature – Leave room for nature.  Though some of these commandments seem harmless enough, the very first describes the supreme sentiment of the mysterious group of masons who erected the stones. If you want further narrative for what they bode, you don\\'t have to look far. As Stanford University Professor, Paul Ehrlich , the author of The Population Bomb states , \"The first task is population control at home. How do we go about it? Many of my colleagues feel that some sort of compulsory birth regulation would be necessary to achieve such control. One plan often mentioned involves the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired population size.\"  We can see clearly that the \\'elite\\' class, intent on ridding the planet of its burdensome load, has already poisoned the water of 42 out of 50 states with lead . Pesticides and fertilizers poison the remaining states\\' water along with the original 42 states. Male infertility is rising due to these contaminants, and premature births along with miscarriage are more common due to others. If the water doesn\\'t kill you, it will simply lobotomize you, or at least start the process. Harvard medical has pronounced that fluoridated water lowered IQ scores in children who drank it, and aluminum along with fluoride is a known neurotoxin, also contributing to the rising numbers of Alzheimer\\'s, Parkinsons, and similar neurodegenerative diseases. READ: 11 Common Symptoms of the Global Depopulation Slow Kill  Should poisoning the water be insufficient to keep the population down, we can look to the advice of David Brower, once Executive Director of the Sierra Club and founder of the Friends of the Earth. He suggests that, \"Childbearing [should be] a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license … All potential parents [should be] required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.\"  Forced and coerced sterilization at the hands of the Eugenics Board and other bodies is nothing new. Some investigators recently found that 148 female inmates in two California prisons were sterilized between 2006 to 2010 — and there may be 100 more incidents dating back to the late 1990s. One reporter wrote , \" The women were signed up for the surgery while they were pregnant and housed at either the California Institution for Women in Corona or Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla, which is now a men\\'s prison.  Former inmates and prisoner advocates maintain that prison medical staff coerced the women, targeting those deemed likely to return to prison in the future.  Crystal Nguyen, a former Valley State Prison inmate who worked in the prison\\'s infirmary during 2007, said she often overheard medical staff asking inmates who had served multiple prison terms to agree to be sterilized.  \"I was like, \\'Oh my God, that\\'s not right,\\'\" Nguyen, 28, said. \" Do they think they\\'re animals, and they don\\'t want them to breed anymore? \"  Today vaccines are used in a similar manner to help cull the population against their informed consent. Eugenicist, Bill Gates tried to \\' field test \\' his HPV vaccine in India on indigenous young girls, but the Indian government eventually brought a stop to this. The Rockefeller family also quietly funds vaccines that alter a woman\\'s hormones to make her less likely to become pregnant or to maintain a pregnancy. A book titled Disciplining Reproduction by Adele E. Clark explains what the elites were planning as early as the 1930s. \" Other lines of current immunological contraceptive research continue to seek what, during the 1930s, Max Mason of the Rockefeller Foundation called \"anti-hormones\": vaccines to block hormones needed for very early pregnancy and a vaccine to block the hormone needed for the surface of the egg to function properly .\"  Barack Obama\\'s top science advisor , John P. Holdren has also said : \" A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child, despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men . The development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control. The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official permission, for a limited number of births.\"  A simple look at the peer-reviewed Plos One site offers over 7,500 additional scientific articles that connect vaccines to sterilization.  Should vaccines or forced implants be insufficient to reduce the number of \\'useless eaters\\' in the world, as Henry Kissinger has implied, then there is also the revealing text of Dr. John Colemann, who outlines the aims of a Committee of 300, otherwise known as the original hierarchical organization to plan a New World Order . Among their plans are genocide, war, the installation of dictators, the legalization of drug use, and the normalizing of pornography : \"To bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. It is interesting to note that Pol Pot\\'s genocidal plans were drawn up in the US by one of the Club of Rome\\'s research foundations, and overseen by Thomas Enders, a high-ranking State Department official. It is also interesting that the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia. \"….To cause by means of limited wars in the advanced countries, by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World countries, the death of three billion people by the year 2050, people they call \\'useless eaters.\\' The Committee of 300 (Illuminati) commissioned Cyrus Vance to write a paper on this subject of how to bring about such genocide. The paper was produced under the title \"Global 2000 Report\" and was accepted and approved for action by former President James Earl Carter, and Edwin Muskie, then Secretary of State, for and on behalf of the US Government. Under the terms of the Global 2000 Report, the population of the US is to be reduced by 100 million by the year of 2050. \"……To encourage, and eventually legalize the use of drugs and make pornography an \\'art-form,\\' which will be widely accepted and, eventually, become quite commonplace.\"  Look no further than Syria , Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, and a myriad other examples of false flag terrorism . Look no further than the top twenty pharmaceutical companies (all U.S., Illuminati based ) that control almost 99 percent of the world\\'s massive, \\'legalized\\' drug trade. See clearly, the genocide happening around the globe , and the child sex trafficking and pornography which is silently abided in Hollywood, Washington, and in every government circle run by cabal-funded individuals.  Look at the money usurped for the task of culling the masses, as former U.S. Secretary of State and presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has stated : \"This year, the United States renewed funding of reproductive healthcare through the United Nations Population Fund, and more funding is on the way. The U.S. Congress recently appropriated more than $648 million in foreign assistance to family planning and reproductive health programs worldwide . That\\'s the largest allocation in more than a decade – since we last had a Democratic president, I might add.\"  Furthermore, weather modification, or geoengineering , also known as chemtrails , additionally help the slow kill , or fast degeneration of the human species. NASA has admitted to using these weather altering programs, so there is no sense denying their presence. Aside from spraying lithium, strontium , barium, nano aluminum-coated fiberglass [known as CHAFF], radioactive thorium, cadmium, chromium, nickel, desiccated blood, mold spores, yellow fungus, and more, these chemical concoctions act as a global pandemic to further population control.  Without mention of contaminated food, DARPA contrived control devices, and further attempts to make slaves of the remaining sheeple who live through these demonic efforts, know this; you are swimming in the depopulation agenda. The effects are all around you, and it is high time to put up some kind of resistance.

Well after midnight, the street was filled with hundreds of young people waiting for a chance to see their hero. The show itself didn\\'t happen, but at one point, a car drove past, and Mr. West poked his head out of the sunroof. The crowd surged and surrounded him after a minute or two, the car pulled away from the throng, leaving a trail of fans chasing it up Third Avenue. It was a beautiful expression of fanaticism engineered by an artist who uses frenzy as paint. And it provided an unexpected foreshadowing of the opening night of Mr. West\\'s \"Saint Pablo\" tour — celebrating his February album, \"The Life of Pablo\" — which came to Bankers Life Fieldhouse here on Thursday night. This performance was like that scene writ large, captured in a consumable experience. There was no formal stage: Mr. West delivered the entire concert from platforms that hovered about 20 feet above the arena floor and beamed light in every direction. The platforms floated out above the crowd slowly, like an Imperial Star Destroyer soaring through space in \"Star Wars. \" At one end of the room was a large screen projecting blurred images from cameras filming Mr. West from various angles, including the ceiling. For much of the night, Mr. West performed on a smallish square platform, tethered to the center by a rope that ran up under his coat as it tilted at various precarious angles. He moved in circles and danced across the floor, using the restraint as a tool at times he sat at the edge and let his feet dangle, and at one point lay prostrate and extended his hand to the crowd, offering a benediction. It made Mr. West both improbably close and tantalizingly out of reach. He was the host, but also a reveler. For the first 20 or so minutes, the crowd maintained a circle around the platform as it crept from one side of the room to the other, staring up at Mr. West and pointing their camera phones while he worked through the more bruising end of his catalog: \"All Day,\" \"Famous,\" \"Mercy,\" \"Don\\'t Like (remix). \" But then, those in the throng realized that they could use the space beneath Mr. West as well, and the floor became a party, like a warehouse rave or, when the beers were flying, a mosh pit at a hardcore show. On each side of the floor, a couple of dozen speakers were blasting physically overwhelming bass, literally pushing fans away from the edges and toward the center. It was a minimalist, elaborately efficient way to deliver an arena show: It got Mr. West closer to both ends of the room, and also to both the fans on the floor and those in the cheap seats way up top. There was even blurring between the insiders and the outsiders — among the revelers on the floor were some of Mr. West\\'s intimates and members of his extended creative team: Virgil Abloh, Scooter Braun, Travis Scott, ASAP Bari. If you were on the floor, you could choose your own way to experience the show — in thrall to Mr. West in the sky, dancing in the light beneath him, or soaking it all in from the fringes. There was little distraction: Mr. West performed to a combination of prerecorded tracks and live accompaniment by the singer Tony Williams the producer and Mike Dean and Caroline Shaw, the Pulitzer composer and vocalist, all of them dressed in black and occupying a small stage at one end of the floor. Mr. West\\'s innovation is the latest in a year full of them Drake, Beyoncé and Rihanna have all made concerted efforts on their tours to shrink oversize spaces, a reconsideration of the power dynamic of live concerts for the age of intimacy and immediacy. The setup wasn\\'t without its complications, though. On two occasions, Mr. West stopped the music because he perceived the tangle of people beneath him to be a little too rowdy. And he spent much of the second half of the show on a larger platform — banging out a beat on an MPC for \"Runaway,\" speaking to the crowd and playing some brighter songs, like \"Good Life\" and \"All of the Lights\" — but stayed closer to the center of it, making him harder to see from the floor. Often Mr. West uses speeches during his shows as a way of collapsing the space between him and the audience, but given that this concert\\'s physical dynamism did that for him, he kept the talking to a minimum. He began one segment by saying, \"Now that I have kids, my perspective has changed,\" before thanking the chief executive of Nike, a company he\\'s had a contentious relationship with in the past, and also Adidas, his current footwear partner. He doubled down on his insistence that art and commerce should play nice. \"Dreams are possible,\" he said, but conceded, \"Every day is a struggle. \" It was almost two hours into the performance at that point, and the crowd\\'s bubbling energy had crested and leveled off. The lights were brighter, and Mr. West remained contemplative, working through bits of \"30 Hours\" and \"Real Friends,\" some of the quieter moments from \"The Life of Pablo. \" By the time he got to \"Only One,\" from 2014 — delivered from the perspective of his mother, who died in 2007 — the room was almost quiet. Here again, Mr. West played with spatial relations — not between him and the crowd, but between him and the unknown, as a circular red light descended over him like a portal to the heavens. Then came snippets of the gospel choir in \"Ultralight Beam,\" delivering slashes of ecstatic faith, followed by the cleansing pulse of \"Fade,\" and a bath of ambient vocals and synthesizers. When the lights came up, Mr. West had evaporated into the mist.', 'Democratic Republic of Congo was among 15 countries elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council for a three-year term on Monday, a moved criticized by Britain, the United States and rights groups after the vote by the 193-member General Assembly. While Congo was elected uncontested to the 47-member Geneva-based council, it still needed majority support. The country - beset by renewed political and militia violence since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down in December - won 151 votes. Political repression, civilian attacks, mass graves. What happened in DRC last year makes their election to the Human Rights council entirely disappointing, British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft posted on Twitter. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who has called for the Human Rights Council votes to be competitive, said Congo s election harmed the credibility of the body. Countries that aggressively violate human rights at home should not be in a position to guard the human rights of others, Haley said in a statement. The United States is reviewing its membership in the council. It is in the first year of a second term, but U.S. President Donald Trump s administration has called for reforms to eliminate what it called its chronic anti-Israel bias. Angola, Senegal, Slovakia, Ukraine, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan, Australia and Spain were also elected to the body on Monday, while Nigeria and Qatar won second terms. Their terms start on Jan. 1, 2018. To ensure geographical representation, states are nominated in five regional categories. Four slates were uncontested, while there were five candidates for four Asia Pacific seats in which Malaysia lost. Council members cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. The council is able to rebuke governments it deems as violating human rights and to order investigations. Human Rights Watch called for elections to be competitive. The Democratic Republic of Congo s election to the Human Rights Council is a slap in the face to the many victims of the Congolese government s grave abuses across the country, said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director at Human Rights Watch.

But tonight, Alec Baldwin went no holds barred and gave his most brutal (and hilarious) performance yet.The skit spoofed Trump s interview with Lester Holt and from start to finish, they nailed Trump to the wall.

Despite what is clearly a terrorist assault employing indiscriminate artillery fire provided by Grad rocket systems on an urban center and the use of suicide bombings employing vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED), Western media organisations are attempting to depict the assault as a \"rebel counter-attack\" meant to \"break\" what it is depicting as a \"siege\" by Syria\\'s own military forces.  Reuters in their article, \" Syrian rebels launch Aleppo counter-attack to break siege ,\" would claim:  It is particularly interesting to see Reuters attempt to depict the assault as a \"rebel\" operation, despite being unable to name a single \"rebel\" group, and admitting the leading role designated foreign terrorist organisation Jabhat Al Nusra is playing as well as the use of clearly terrorist tactics being employed.  Reuters continues by admitting much further down in its article that:  Fateh al-Sham played a big part in a rebel attack in July that managed to break the government siege on eastern Aleppo for several weeks before it was reimposed.  Abu Youssef al-Mouhajir, an official from the powerful Ahrar al-Sham Islamist group, said the extent of cooperation between the different rebel factions was unusual, and that the largest axis of attack was on the western edge of the city.  Reuters is all but admitting that even the so-called \"rebels\" it attempts to credit the assault with are operating not under the banner of the \"Free Syrian Army,\" but ultimately under the banner of Jabhat Al Nusra, quite literally Al Qaeda in Syria.  Reuters concedes that this \"complicates\" US foreign policy in Syria, claiming that heavier weapons cannot be passed on to \"rebels\" in fear that they would immediately fall into the hands of terrorist groups \"rebels\" are clearly operating under. Reuters, however, never explains why any weapons at all would be provided to \"rebel\" groups so clearly and transparently in league with Jabhat Al Nusra in the first place.  Finally, Reuters claims:  Grad rockets were launched at Aleppo\\'s Nairab air base before the assault began said Zakaria Malahiji, head of the political office of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim rebel group, adding that it was going to be \"a big battle\".  The Observatory also said that Grad surface-to-surface rockets had struck locations around the Hmeimim air base, near Latakia.  Grad rockets are an effective weapon in combat on open terrain. In the confined urban environment of Aleppo, they are an indiscriminate weapon the West, its media and its human rights advocates have little trouble pointing out their use constitutes a war crime, but only when used by forces of nations the West seeks to undermine and ultimately overthrow. No mention of their indiscriminate, inappropriate nature when used in urban environments is made when used by forces backed by Western interests.  Also, Reuters\\' inadvertently mentions the \"rebel\" group Fastaqim in the closing paragraphs of its report, a faction operating under the Aleppo-based Fatah Halab (Aleppo Conquest) coalition. It was revealed by the West\\'s own rights advocacy group, Amnesty International, in a post titled, \" Syria: armed opposition group committing war crimes in Aleppo – new evidence ,\" that:  The Aleppo Conquest armed groups may have used chemical weapons, as well as \\'hell cannon\\' gas canister munitions.  Armed groups surrounding the predominantly Kurdish Sheikh Maqsoud district of Aleppo city have repeatedly carried out indiscriminate attacks – possibly including with chemical weapons – that have struck civilian homes, markets and mosques, killing and injuring civilians, and have displayed a shameful disregard for human life, said Amnesty International today.  Indeed, even groups described as \"rebels\" by the Western media, are guilty of serial offences that clearly make them terrorists, not \"rebels.\" The fact that this information is omitted from Reuters\\' reports and the nature of these groups\\' relationship with Al Qaeda affiliates made as intentionally nebulous as possible, reveals a common theme that has run through Western coverage of the Syrian conflict since it began; a concerted effort to conceal the true terroristic nature of so-called \"rebels\" in a bid to legitimize the illegitimate, and defend the indefensible.', 'Thursday on CNN, Sen. Rand Paul ( ) said the reactions on the left to President Donald Trump\\'s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change were \"alarmist\" and \"ridiculous. \" Paul said, \"We should try to constrain pollution. We should try to control pollution. I think we\\'ve been doing that for 50 or 60 years. And I think we should continue. But your previous guest sounded like, my goodness, the sky is falling, mass extinction. Really? I don\\'t think we should be alarmists about this. The planet is 4. 5 billion years old. We have gone through great extremes of climate change natural and now we may have influence as well. \" \"But these people, the question I always ask the alarmists is how much is nature and how much is man?\" he continued. \"They act as if it\\'s a given that man is the only source of climate change. My goodness, the great climate changes in our history happened before the industrial revolution. So is there climate change could man have an impact? Yes, but let\\'s not be such alarmists that if we don\\'t sign the Paris accord that there\\'s going to be mass extinction? That\\'s a ridiculous statement. \" Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN', 'Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who has been advising Donald Trump informally on foreign policy, will join Drone Aviation Holding Corp as vice chairman of its board of directors, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Flynn, who was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012-2014 and has since been advising Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, wants the United States to work more closely with Russia to resolve global security issues. \"Having evaluated the (company\\'s) technologies, I believe they can positively impact our military\\'s defense and situational awareness and that is why I am joining Jay and his team in expanding the role of persistent aerial solutions in the marketplace,\" Flynn said in the statement, referring to company CEO Jay Nussbaum. Drone Aviation develops and manufactures aerostats and electric-powered drones to give its customers \"enhanced surveillance and communication capabilities.\" The company\\'s customers include the U.S. military, Saudi Arabia and the Ecuadorian Air Force, according to its website. Flynn resigned as the head of the Pentagon\\'s main intelligence agency a year before his term was officially due to end. He raised eyebrows among some U.S. foreign policy veterans when he was pictured sitting at the head table with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a banquet in Moscow late last year celebrating Russia Today, an international broadcasting network funded by the Russian government. He told Russia Today in an interview published on Dec. 10 that the United States and Russia should work together to resolve the Syrian civil war and defeat the Islamic State militant group. Flynn\\'s experience would \"help ensure that our tethered solutions, today and in the future, will continue to meet the needs of our soldiers and security forces at home and abroad as they respond to evolving threats,\" Nussbaum said in the same statement.', 'Following the presidential debate, Donald Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson opened her mouth on CBS and stupidity just flowed out of it. Pierson was on the show to discuss Donald Trump s debate performance on Monday. When Trump wasn t sniffling, he was interrupting Hillary Clinton.Naturally, Pierson blamed Hillary Clinton for Donald Trump touting the stop-and-frisk policy, which by the way, was ruled unconstitutional in 2013.During the post-debate panel, Pierson was asked to comment on Donald Trump s recent proposal to get more cities to adopt the kind of stop-and-frisk policy in New York that was found unconstitutional back in 2013. As a shock to no one ever, Rudy Giuliani, a huge Trump supporter, is and was a proponent of the racist policy.Pierson took another route and blamed Clinton, because of course: In responding, Pierson said that stop-and-frisk was effective at stopping crime and was not really racist but then she blamed Hillary Clinton for stop-and-frisk being necessary because of her own racism. It actually did work in New York, Pierson said of the stop-and-frisk policy. But we have to get down to why, because that s why we re here today. We have two candidates who have very different views. The reason why we have this problem, the reason why stop-and-frisk was implemented, was there were disparities with regard to who people were pulling over, she continued. She went on to say: And it s profiling, criminal profiling, not necessarily racial profiling, even though it comes across that way. But the reason why we had it was that we had the First Lady of the United States who went out on the national stage and dehumanized young black children this has been the conditioning of the American public where black children have been demonized, Hillary Clinton owns that. Watch:In late August, Trump tweeted, How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth SUPER PREDATORS Has she apologized? Yes, Hillary Clinton made the super predators remark more than 20 years ago, but it was not directed toward African-American children.This is nothing new for Pierson. Just last month, she blamed President Obama for Iraq war deaths in 2004.', 'When it came to naming their third son a few weeks ago, Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green sidestepped traditional boys names like Ethan and Jacob for the name Journey, which may have been a subtle nod to the couple\\'s attempts to work their way back from the brink of divorce. Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell also opted for an name (Delta) for their second daughter, born last year. \"It was a joke, because our first daughter\\'s name is Lincoln, which is very masculine,\" Mr. Shepard said on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show. \" \"So a friend of mine teasingly texted me: \\'Oh, great! What\\'s this one going to be? Navy Seal? Delta Force? \\'\" Their choice hardly seems unusual in a culture where Heidi Klum, Jessica Simpson and Drew Barrymore have all chosen names for their daughters that could go either way and collectively sound like a frontcourt for the 1962 Detroit Pistons (Lou, for Ms. Klum\\'s daughter Maxwell, for Ms. Simpson\\'s and Frankie, for Ms. Barrymore\\'s). It\\'s not just Hollywood. At a time when Banana Republic has done away with pink and blue distinctions in a children\\'s line, some high schools have stopped using graduation gowns with different colors for boys and girls, and unisex is de rigueur in fashion, baby names are on the rise among American parents. \"The old \\'Boy Named Sue\\' idea of a boy being shamed by having a girl\\'s name is passing away,\" said Pamela Redmond Satran, a founder of the popular baby naming site Nameberry, which attracts five million unique visitors monthly, and last December called \"post gender\" names (that is, a name given to both boys and girls in roughly equal measure) the hottest trend for 2016. \"Today, boys named Tatum feel as cool as girls named Rory, and vice versa. \" The numbers seem to bear this out. Researchers at Nameberry analyzed the baby name registry from the Social Security Administration and found that the number of babies given unisex names like Harper, Tatum and Quinn had risen 60 percent in the last decade, to 67, 831 babies in 2015. The increase was even greater over the last three decades, with the number of unisex baby names having risen 88 percent since 1985. The most popular unisex names in 2015, the researchers found, were Hayden (about 39 percent girls, 61 percent boys) Charlie (about 48 percent girls, 52 percent boys) Emerson (about 60 percent girls, 40 percent boys) Rowan (about 35 percent girls, 65 percent boys) and Finley (about 60 percent girls, 40 percent boys). Rounding out the Top 10 were River, Dakota, Skyler, Phoenix and Tatum. (For the purposes of the article, Nameberry researchers defined a name as unisex when at least 35 percent of the babies given it were of one sex, and the rest of the other.) Some of the unisex names are novel and could be called the version of neologisms: Royal, Justice and Phoenix. Others are traditional, and have lost their identity over time. Thirty years ago, for example, Tracy was nearly eight times more common for girls than for boys. Last year, there was a nearly split between boys and girls named Tracy, according to government data. Similarly, Elliott (in its various spellings) was running almost in favor of boys years ago last year, about one Elliott in four was a girl. Other names have seen their eroded more quickly. Boys make up about 38 percent of children named Tatum, but it was 90 percent girls a decade ago, according to Social Security records. Haydens are now about 39 percent girls, up from 11 percent 10 years ago. On BabyCenter, a popular parenting site owned by Johnson Johnson, users have adopted acronyms like BNOG (boy name on girl) GNOB (girl name on boy) and GN ( ) when discussing naming strategies. \"Today\\'s parents have moved beyond the dichotomy of boy and girl names,\" said Linda Murray, the editor in chief of BabyCenter, which declared 2015 \"the year of the baby\" and published a list of 120 suggestions, from Addison to Winter. \"They want their children to grow up and be themselves, free from stereotypes,\" she said. \"Boys can wear nail polish, girls can ride skateboards. It\\'s all good. \" The vogue for unisex names is being driven, in part, by millennials, who are in their 20s and early 30s and in their prime years. \"Millennials are an and accepting group,\" Ms. Murray said, \"and they don\\'t want their children to feel pressured to conform to stereotypes that might be restrictive. \" Indeed, marketers have found that gender neutrality is a selling point for millennials raised in an era of growing economic opportunities for women and increasing tolerance for nontraditional gender roles and identities. Raising a child free of gender stereotypes was a goal for Chelsea Marsh, a millennial parent from Fort Wayne, Ind. when she and her husband gave their daughter the name Paris. \"I wouldn\\'t go as far as to name my baby girl Jack,\" said Ms. Marsh, a sales agent. \"But my goal is to allow her to experience the world without the barriers of pink girlie things. I want her to be strong, play in the dirt and challenge herself to try new things, even if it\\'s not \\'what girls do. \\'\" \"I would do the same for my son,\" she added, \"if he wanted to be a dancer instead of a basketball player. \" parents, whose numbers are growing, may also be inclined to blur traditional gender boundaries. To Yojana Vazquez and her wife, Elaine, choosing the names Kai and Kalo for their twin daughters, now 2, was part of a larger plan to keep gender options open, Ms. Vazquez said. \"Instead of always referring to them as our daughters, we say our children or kids,\" said Ms. Vazquez, 29, of Springfield, Va. \"We also try to dress them in clothing from all over the children\\'s department. We mix and match, a pink girlie shirt with a boy\\'s cargo shorts. A superhero boy\\'s shirt with a tutu skirt. \" The goal, she said, is \"to make sure not to influence them on who they are and, ultimately, who they will grow up to be. \" trends, it should be noted, come with a word of caution. Like all trends, some turn out to be nothing more than fads. Last month, for example, BabyCenter reported an uptick in baby names like Eevee and Onix, inspired by Pokémon Go. names have come into vogue before, Ms. Satran said, first in the 1960s among counterculture types (recall the babies named Sunshine and Rain) and again in the 1980s among baby boomer parents who hoped that giving their daughters names like Blake or Madison would better equip them to take on men in the workplace. Still, unisex baby names account for only a small percentage of those chosen each year. Of the 3. 9 million babies born last year, only 1. 7 percent were given unisex names, according to Nameberry\\'s analysis of government data. The most popular baby names in the country continued to be Noah and Liam for boys, and Emma and Olivia for girls. Even so, in an era marked by Caitlyn Jenner\\'s endlessly publicized transition from Bruce, as well as shows like Amazon\\'s \"Transparent,\" the unisex baby name may also prove to be in its infancy. \"Feminism is cool again, gay marriage is the law of the land and transgender celebrities have come into the mainstream,\" said Ms. Satran, the author of 10 books. \"So who knows? We may yet see the day when boys are named Caitlyn and girls are named Bruce, and nobody thinks twice. \"', 'The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it disagreed with FBI Director James Comey\\'s assessment that the department as a whole has a lax attitude toward security compared to other U.S. government agencies. \"We don\\'t share the broad assessment made of our institution that there\\'s a lax culture here when it comes to protecting classified information. We take it very, very seriously,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. His comments came after Comey announced some of the results of the FBI\\'s yearlong investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\\'s use of a private email server while she was in office. Comey said the FBI found evidence of a general lack of care for classified information at the State Department.', 'South Korea plans to buy an additional 20 F-35A stealth fighter aircraft from the United States, a South Korean newspaper reported on Thursday, less than two months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced Seoul would be purchasing billions of dollars in new military equipment.

Trump presidency is dire. Mr. Trump has pointed to Mrs. Clinton\\'s noticeably scant schedule of campaign events this summer to suggest she has been hiding from the public. But Mrs. Clinton has been more than accessible to those who reside in some of the country\\'s most moneyed enclaves and are willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to see her. In the last two weeks of August, Mrs. Clinton raked in roughly $50 million at 22 events, averaging around $150, 000 an hour, according to a New York Times tally. And while Mrs. Clinton has faced criticism for her failure to hold a news conference for months, she has fielded hundreds of questions from the ultrarich in places like the Hamptons, Martha\\'s Vineyard, Beverly Hills and Silicon Valley. \"It\\'s the old adage, you go to where the money is,\" said Jay S. Jacobs, a prominent New York Democrat. Mrs. Clinton raised about $143 million in August, the campaign\\'s best month yet. At a single event on Tuesday in Sagaponack, N. Y. 10 people paid at least $250, 000 to meet her, raising $2. 5 million. If Mr. Trump appears to be waging his campaign in rallies and network interviews, Mrs. Clinton\\'s second presidential bid seems to amount to a series of with public appearances added to the schedule when they can be fit in. Last week, for example, she diverged just once from her packed schedule to deliver a speech. Robby Mook, the Clinton campaign manager, said 2. 3 million people had contributed to the campaign, which has significantly increased the number of donors who give online in small increments. The public has gotten used to seeing Mrs. Clinton\\'s carefully choreographed appearances and her somewhat halting speeches and TV interviews over the course of the long — and sometimes seemingly joyless — campaign, but donors this summer have glimpsed an entirely different person. It is clear from interviews with more than a dozen attendees of Mrs. Clinton\\'s finance events this summer and a handful of pictures and videos of her at the gatherings that Mrs. Clinton, often described as warm and personable in small settings, whoever the audience, can be especially relaxed, candid and even joyous in this company. Mrs. Clinton\\'s aides have gone to great lengths to project an image of her as and attuned to the challenges of what she likes to call \"the struggling and the striving. \" She began her campaign last year riding in a van to Iowa from New York and spent much of last summer hosting discussions with a handful of what her campaign called \"everyday Americans\" in Iowa and New Hampshire. Yet some of the closest relationships Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have are with their longstanding contributors. If she feels most at ease around millionaires, within the gilded bubble, it is in part because they are some of her most intimate friends. \"It\\'s like going to a wedding or a bar mitzvah — you catch up,\" explained Mitchell Berger, a Democratic donor in Florida, about the familial nature of the events. Mr. Berger would know: He has been raising money for the Clintons since he held a in his Fort Lauderdale office for Mr. Clinton the day after he announced his candidacy in 1991. Mr. Berger, who joined Mrs. Clinton last month at a donor event in Miami Beach, said many of the individual conversations before and after she speaks at the gatherings are centered more on grandchildren than weighty policy matters. But when she has had a this summer about issues, Mrs. Clinton, who has promised to \"reshuffle the deck\" in favor of the middle class and portrayed Mr. Trump as an billionaire, has almost exclusively been fielding the concerns of the wealthiest Americans. To businessmen who complain to Mrs. Clinton that President Obama has been unfriendly to their interests, she says she would approach business leaders more like Mr. Clinton did during his administration, which was widely considered amicable to the private sector. When financiers complain about the regulations implemented by the financial overhaul, Mrs. Clinton reaffirms her support for strong Wall Street regulation, but adds that she is open to listening to anyone\\'s ideas and at times notes that she represented the banking industry as a senator. The wealthy contributors who host Mrs. Clinton often complain about her opposition to the Partnership and express concerns that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont pushed her to the left on trade and other issues. Mrs. Clinton reminds them she has both opposed and supported trade deals in the past. And, as she noted at an event last month on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Mrs. Clinton points out that she worked cooperatively with Republicans when she served in the Senate and would do so as president. \"I\\'d say the major themes are small business, regulation and getting people back to work,\" said Alan Patricof, a financier and longtime donor to Mrs. Clinton. The campaign\\'s finance team is led by Dennis Cheng, previously the chief for the Clinton Foundation, and it employs a couple dozen staff members. Mr. Cheng, who attends the events with Mrs. Clinton, offers donors a number of contribution options that provide them and their families varying levels of access to Mrs. Clinton. John Morgan, a Florida lawyer and donor, described Mr. Cheng as \"the master concierge. \" For a donation of $2, 700, the children (under 16) of donors at an event last month at the Sag Harbor, N. Y. estate of the hedge fund magnate Adam Sender could ask Mrs. Clinton a question. A family photo with Mrs. Clinton cost $10, 000, according to attendees. And when Mrs. Clinton attended a dinner at the Beverly Hills home of the entertainment executive Haim Saban last month, the invitation was very clear. If attendees wanted to dine and receive a photo with Mrs. Clinton they had to pay their own way: \"Write not raise\" $100, 000. Another advantage to choosing private over town halls or other public events is that Mrs. Clinton can bask in an affectionate embrace as hosts try to limit confrontational engagements. Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, a backer of Democrats and a friend of the Clintons\\' made sure attendees did not grill Mrs. Clinton at the $ lamb dinner Mrs. Forester de Rothschild hosted under a tent on the lawn of her oceanfront Martha\\'s Vineyard mansion. \"I said, \\'Let\\'s make it a nice night for her and show her our love,\\'\" Mrs. Forester de Rothschild said. candidates from both parties often rely on August to reach vacationing donors who open their wallets, and their palatial homes. In 2012, the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, brought in close to $4 million over a single weekend from events in the Hamptons. And Mr. Trump, while netting $64 million through online and in July, also made the trek this summer to the eastern end of Long Island to raise cash. But Mr. and Mrs. Clinton have occupied a particular place in the social fabric of the enclave. Over the past several summers, they have spent the last two weeks of August in a rented home with a heated pool in East Hampton and in a mansion with a private path to the beach in Sagaponack. This year, the former first couple stayed in the guesthouse of Steven Spielberg\\'s East Hampton compound built on nine acres overlooking Georgica and Lily Ponds. Mr. Trump\\'s candidacy has allowed Mrs. Clinton to reach out to a new set of donors in the area who typically give to Republicans but dislike the current nominee. (Mr. Trump feels more at home at in Palm Beach, Fla. than in the Hamptons, where the exclusive Maidstone Club once denied him a membership, according to The New York Post.) \"The Hamptons is full of powerful, wealthy people who are bored and go to constant social events to see who else got invited and to show your status,\" said Ken Sunshine, a veteran Democratic activist and public relations executive with a home in Remsenburg, N. Y. \"This year,\" he added, \"going to a Clinton event is at the very top of the list. \"', \"By now, everyone knows that the Jared Kushner vs. Stephen K. Bannon infighting in the White House is coming to a head. It has resulted in the removal of Bannon from the National Security Council. Apparently, Kushner had a hand in getting Bannon s hands off our national security, so, for this one, go Jared. We now have a much more secure nation, thanks to his removal. One person who couldn t wait to mock the white nationalist s takedown by his own was Late Show host Stephen Colbert.Colbert started that part of his monologue by mocking Bannon s resistance to being taken off the NSC, saying: Today we re learning more about a huge event yesterday when Steve Bannon was removed from the National Security Council. It s so nice to have Bannon fans here to night. They re so rare, so rare. It was not easy to remove Bannon. They held a hot match to his back until he released his pincers. And, they think the head might still be in there. He might get an infection. Colbert then went on to express disbelief that this was not a demotion: I m not sure if he accomplished his goal. There are still some Muslims in America. There s still some, right? Can you check on that? Still a couple.Word on the street is that Jared Kushner helped push Bannon out. How many jobs does that kid have? I m not sure I m surprised by this. I m not surprised at all in fact, because there is known friction between these two.Whenever Kushner s not around, Bannon calls him a cuck. And Bannon tried to stop the demotion, threatening at one point to quit if it went forward. Wait, wait a second, Steve Bannon, you threatened to quit if you got kicked off the National Security Council? Then you got kicked off and you didn t quit? That s a TCM, bro! TOTAL CUCK MOVE! This is absolutely brilliant. There is so much goodness in that clip, that it has to be watched repeatedly to be fully appreciated.Watch below via The Late Show Twitter:Tonight: Steve Bannon, forced off the NSC by White House rival Jared Kushner, commits what some are calling a 'TCM.' #LSSC #TCM pic.twitter.com/AllTUQt2aI The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) April 7, 2017\", 'Suggestions Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election are absurd and a renewed dialogue is needed between Washington and Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.

He said Russia hoped coordination with United States on the Syria crisis would improve under the new U.S. president.', 'The European Union s chief Brexit negotiator told German industry on Wednesday that it was his responsibility to help European companies weather the exit of Britain from the EU, and he warned Britain that its economy had much to lose. In a series of speeches, Michel Barnier also said work remained to be done on how much Britain would pay the EU to cover its share of the EU budget after it leaves. British newspapers have reported his team has broadly agreed on a payment of around 50 billion euros ( 44 billion). The EU has given Britain until Monday to make an acceptable offer for a financial settlement, agree on the rights of EU citizens in Britain and ensure no hard border is set up with Ireland. Only then will it start talks on a future trade pact. German business is worried about the impact of Brexit - Britain is Germany s third-largest export destination and its fifth-biggest overall trading partner. The future of the EU is more important than Brexit, Barnier told the BDA employers association and the BDI industry group and DIHK chambers of commerce. Barnier said he wasn t sure if the whole truth had been explained to British business on the impact of Brexit. My responsibility before you and everywhere in Europe is to tell the truth to European businesses, he said in the speech to the BDA employers association. A trading relationship with a non-EU member inevitably involved friction, he said. Whatever the outcome of the current negotiations, there will be no business as usual, he said. Some politicians in Britain have argued that German companies depend on them for business, so Berlin under Chancellor Angela Merkel may help London get a deal. But only about 6 percent of Germany s trade in goods is with the United Kingdom, compared with 56 percent with the other EU countries, Barnier said - making it clear Britain had the most to lose. Barnier also pointed to value-added tax returns and the imports of animals and animal projects that are subject to checks at the EU s borders as potential problems. And he warned there was no guarantee that judgements by UK courts on trade disputes would automatically be recognised across the EU after Brexit. The BDI industry association and DIHK chambers of commerce stressed that the onus was on the British government to shift in its negotiations. The British government must move so that the EU can give the green light in two weeks for phase two of the talks, said the BDI and DIHK groups. There can be no cherry picking for London. It is clear: our priority is to strengthen the EU and develop it further, they said, stressing that the freedoms of the internal market would not be diluted for Britain during any transition phase. Barnier also warned that companies should prepare for a possible no deal , which implies returning to trade tariffs under World Trade Organisation rules, and border controls. That scenario would lead to higher transport and storage costs, hitting companies operating on a just-in-time basis, he said. The no-deal scenario is not our scenario, but since it cannot be ruled out, we have to prepare for it, he said.', 'Progressives Find \\'White Trash\\' More Threatening Tnan Nuclear War Paul Craig Roberts The American electorate\\'s preference for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders has established two facts. One is that the majority of the American people do not believe the media presstitutes. The other is that only the \"progressives\" and \"liberals\" who inhabit the Atlantic Northeast and Pacific West coasts believe the presstitutes. Trump\\'s election to the presidency has confirmed these holier-than-thou souls in their strongly held belief that America is a white trash racist country. They have told us this all day long today. From these people and from the presstitutes we hear that white supremacy elected Trump. This is their propaganda, the intention of which is to discredit a Trump administration before it is inaugerated. Funny how white supremacy elected black Obama twice previously. Truthout has lost it completely. John Knefel declares \"The David Dukes of the World Prevail.\" Kelly Hayes declares \"White Supremacy Elected Donald Trump.\" William Rivers Pitt declares \"We have elected a fascist that Mussolini would have recognized on sight.\" Hillary carried only a handful of states, the states that comprise the One Percent\\'s stomping grounds. Yet Amy Goodman of Democracy Now sees meaning in political writer John Nichols claim that as Hillary carried New York and California, she won the popular vote and should be in the White House. I remember a few days ago George Soros saying that Trump would win the popular vote, but that the electoral vote would go to Hillary, thus ridding the oligarchs of Trump. Earth Justice promises to hold Trump accountable. Trump who promises to end the threat of nuclear war with Russia and China, thereby doing more to save animal and human life than the entirety of the Democratic Party and environmental organizations, is going to be held accountable by an organization that allegedly is beyond politics and is dedicated to preserving animals from destruction. The ACLU, of which I am a member, has also put \"on notice\" the president-elect who has said he will save us from nuclear war. Faced with this idiocy from the ACLU, I will not renew my membership. Feminists tell us that we are \"grieving, scared, and in shock,\" and that \"it is critical that we stand together and support each other.\" Jeremy Ben-Ami of the J Street Jewish Community tells us that it is \"an incredibly sad and difficult day. For tens of millions of Americans who share a core belief in tolerance, decency and social justice, the election results are a severe shock. In this challenging moment, we turn to one another for comfort and community. During this election, J Street made unequivocally clear our conviction that Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States.\" Van Jones, a CNN commentator, said that Trump\\'s election is a nightmare, \"a deeply painful moment,\" a \"whitelash\" against minorities. While he bemoaned the pain inflicted upon poor little presstitute Van Jones, he didn\\'t mind insulting the American electorate and the President-elect of the United States. After all, Van Jones sees that as his racist prerogative. And so, the holier-than-thou crowd prefers Hillary, despite her unambigious position that she would maximize conflict with Russia and China, provoke direct military conflict between the US and Russia by imposing a no-fly zone in Syria, attack Iran and other of Israel\\'s targets, further enrich her Wall Street handlers by privatizing Social Security, and prevent any dissent from the lowly people class of her high-handed ways. If William Rivers Pitt sees Trump as a Mussolini fascist, Trump is too mild for Pitt. He prefers Hillary, a Hitler to the third power. The progressives have totally discredited themselves just as the presstitutes have done. Their need for a bogyman to nourish their hysteria indicates serious psychological disturbance. They actually prefer the risk of Armageddon to peace among nuclear powers. As their 501(c)3s live off corporate contributions, they prefer globalist corporate profits to jobs for ordinary Americans. These are the people who think of themselves as our instructors and our betters.  If only Trump could exile the lot of them. They are anti-American to the core.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he guaranteed the deduction would not be entirely scrapped in a final tax bill that emerges from dueling plans already unveiled by Republicans in the House and the Senate. Asked on \"Fox News Sunday\" if House Republicans would reject a bid by Senate Republicans to do away with the deduction entirely, Brady said: \"That\\'s what I\\'m saying.\" The deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, has been one of the most hotly contested issues as Republicans seek to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand President Donald Trump his first major legislative victory. It is a chief concern for a group of House Republicans who face re-election battles next year in high-tax, typically Democratic-leaning states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Other sticking points include a proposal by the Senate to delay implementation of a cut in the corporate tax rate and a House plan to eliminate the estate tax on inheritances. Republicans control both the House and the Senate. Lawmakers will debate their respective plans this week before heading home for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. Republicans hope to resolve their differences in time to reach their goal of enacting the legislation by the end of the year. The Senate tax blueprint introduced on Thursday would repeal the SALT deduction entirely. The House bill would repeal it only for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserve it for property tax up to $10,000 a year. Brady said there were many similarities in the rival tax proposals. \"I know that everyone\\'s stressing the differences - there are some - but there\\'s far more common ground,\" he said. Both the House and Senate plans would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the budget deficit and national debt, an increase that has worried some fiscally conservative Republicans. Both plans also call for deep tax cuts for high-earners and businesses and would reshape how the United States taxes multinational corporations. They are both widely seen as a boon for business. Congressional Democrats have criticized the Republican plans as lopsided, favoring wealthy Americans and corporate interests. \"Both the House and the Senate bills would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, particularly in the suburbs, while providing a huge giveaway to corporations and the wealthy,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. \"Republicans should go back to the drawing board and fully restore the SALT deduction,\" he said in a statement. Some analyses show that some Americans would see a tax increase under both plans. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin acknowledged that on CNN\\'s \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, although he said most middle-class families would be better off. \"For most people - and, again, it may not be 100 percent, but by far the majority - both the House and Senate version provide middle-income tax relief,\" he said. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said both plans adhere to Trump\\'s two main objectives in overhauling the tax code: a tax cut for middle-income Americans and a deep reduction in the corporate tax rate to make U.S. businesses competitive. \"That\\'s how we\\'re going to grow the economy. That\\'s how we\\'re going to pay for the tax bill,\" Cohn said on Fox\\'s \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" A report by Congress\\' Joint Committee on Taxation estimated earlier this month that the House bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $20,000 and $40,000 per year, beginning in 2023. Republican Representative Peter King has fiercely opposed the elimination of the SALT deduction, saying many in his home state of New York earning $300,000 a year were hardworking, two-income families facing a very high cost of living. \"They\\'re not hedge fund people,\" King said on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"These are hardworking people and they\\'re going to get screwed by this bill.\"', \"In the days following the massacre at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Donald Trump has tried to claim that he is a better ally to LGBT Americans than Hillary Clinton. Trump said: Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists into our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone else who doesn t share their views or values. But a few months ago, Trump posed for a photo alongside Robert Jeffress, a right-wing pastor who is notorious for being anti-LGBT.

Honored to pray for my friend, @realDonaldTrump, at tonight s Dallas rally, Jeffress tweeted, along with a photo in which they both held their thumbs up. Trump retweeted the image on Friday.Jeffress has pushed rhetoric on gay people eerily similar to that espoused by extremist groups like ISIS.The First Baptist Church pastor in February 2015 was quoted as saying the gay rights movement will pave the way for that future world dictator, the Antichrist, to persecute and martyr Christians without any repercussions whatsoever. Jeffress last month celebrated his state s leaders decision to refuse to comply with President Barack Obama s directive to create more accessibility for transgender students in public schools, saying it s time for an all-out rebellion against this absolute tyranny of the Obama administration. In reality, anti-LGBT rhetoric has been the norm within Republican politics. All the leading candidates for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination were connected to the anti-LGBT movement, most blatantly Senator Ted Cruz, but the practice spread to the entire party.While Democrats dragged their feet to become completely in favor of LGBT equality, the party is also the first to nominate a presidential candidate President Obama who supported same-sex marriage. By contrast, the notion of repealing the right to same-sex marriage is still popular within the Republican party.Featured image Joe Raedle/Getty Images\", 'The head of the eastern-based Libyan National Army ordered an investigation on Saturday into the case of 36 unidentified bodies found near Benghazi two days earlier.

Cheney reportedly told CNN on Friday he intends to support the GOP nominee in 2016, just as he has every prior cycle. Shortly after the first presidential debate, Cheney told Fox News\\' Bret Baier that the real estate mogul\\'s assertions regarding the September 11 attacks—including that George W. Bush willingly let them happen—were \"way off base.\" \"He clearly doesn\\'t understand or has not spent any time learning about the facts of that period,\" Cheney said. It\\'s a little curious that Cheney has decided to board the Trump Train. It\\'s also a break from the rest of Bush World, as representatives for George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush say neither former president will back the mogul\\'s presidential bid. In 2011, Trump made a YouTube video for his \"From The Desk of Donald Trump\" series, (a series I cannot recommend highly enough), in which the presumptive nominee trashed the former VP and his then-newly released memoir. \"He\\'s very, very angry and nasty,\" the mogul said. \"I didn\\'t like Cheney when he was a vice president. I don\\'t like him now. And I don\\'t like people that rat out everybody like he\\'s doing in the book. I\\'m sure it\\'ll be a best-seller, but isn\\'t it a shame? Here\\'s a guy that did a rotten job as vice president. Nobody liked him. Tremendous divisiveness. And he\\'s gonna be making a lot of money on the book. I won\\'t be reading it.\" \"It just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing,\" he said, discussing Nancy Pelosi with Wolf Blitzer on The Situation Room. \"He got us into the war with lies,\" he continued. \"And, I mean, look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant. And they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. And, yet, Bush got us into this horrible war with lies, by lying, by saying they had weapons of mass destruction, by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true.\" \"Religious freedom\\'s been a very important part of our history and where we came from,\" he added—but if Cheney has anything to do with it, then Trump\\'s America is where we\\'re going.', 'U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is due to testify before a congressional committee next week, three sources familiar with the matter said on Monday, offering Democrats a chance to question him about his past statements on President Donald Trump\\'s campaign exchanges with Russian intermediaries. Sessions\\' testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, which has not been publicly announced, was confirmed by a Justice Department spokesman and two congressional aides. The open hearing, tentatively scheduled for Nov. 14, is part of the committee\\'s regular oversight of the Justice Department, but Russia appears almost certain to be a topic. Separately, Sessions is due to appear in a closed session before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 14, a source familiar with that panel\\'s plans said. Senate Democrats last week demanded that Sessions be recalled to testify on the Trump campaign\\'s Russia contacts after the disclosure of an effort to set up a meeting between then-Republican candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. That, they said, conflicted with Sessions\\' earlier statements to Congress. The effort to set up a Trump-Putin meeting - which never took place - was disclosed in court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia\\'s role in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was collusion between Trump aides and the Kremlin. According to the documents, George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, said at a March 31, 2016, meeting of Trump foreign policy advisers \"that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.\" Both Sessions and Trump attended that meeting, according to a photo posted on Trump\\'s Instagram account. Democrats want to question Sessions because, in October, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that a continuing exchange between the Trump campaign and Russian government intermediaries \"did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.\" Sessions has denied misleading congressional committees about his interactions regarding Russia. He had to recuse himself from investigations into the alleged Russian interference after it was revealed in March that he met with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at least twice in 2016. J.D. Gordon, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who was at the March 2016 meeting, told Reuters that Papadopoulos indeed \"made a pitch for meeting with Putin.\" But Sessions shot the idea down, Gordon said. \"Yes, within minutes. He was quite clear. We thought that was the end of it.\" Papadopoulos continued trying to arrange contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, the court filings say.', 'Racists and Confederate flag worshipers may be celebrating now but Director Rob Reiner just informed them that Trump s victory will be their last.On Monday while promoting his film LBJ, which follows President Lyndon Johnson s effort to secure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Reiner declared that Trump represents the final battle of the Civil War, which ended in 1865 and was responsible for the deaths of 600,000 Americans. The way I look at it, if you are trying to take an overview the holistic approach we are fighting the last big major battle of the Civil War, Reiner said, pointing out that people are protesting Trump for the opposite reason why Southerners protested Abraham Lincoln when he was elected in 1860. There s only been two times in the history of America where upon the election of a president, the people en masse took to the streets, Reiner said. One was Abraham Lincoln, and the other was Donald Trump. And for obviously, you know, 180-degree different reasons, but both based on race. Indeed, the South hated Lincoln because they wanted to keep the institution of slavery alive. Anti-Trump protesters hate Trump because they don t want America to be a haven for racists who want to go back to the days of slavery or segregation.Millions of Americans fear that Trump will reign over an era where racism and discrimination is acceptable and is propped up by the federal government. To me, the scariest part of what we saw with Donald Trump was not understanding how much racism still existed in this country, Reiner continued. It was kind of papered over for a while. I mean, we had the Civil Rights Act, we had the Voting Rights Act and then in the 70s we had All in the Family started shining a light on racial unrest. And then we had a lot of enormous success by African-Americans in the media, in the news and so on. And then culminating with an African American president. So we thought, OK, we are moving in the right direction, everything is moving. But what we didn t realize that this undercurrent of racism was still there, virulent and kind of down, suppressed. But now the media is largely to blame for giving Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters a platform to bring the cause of white supremacists into the mainstream. And Reiner blasted them for it. I don t know if you saw Leslie Stahl last night, Reiner said in reference to Trump s 60 Minutes interview on Sunday. It s embarrassing. It is embarrassing that somebody who has a national platform would softball this moron. He s a moron. And that man is in the White House now, and the press normalized him. They normalized him for a long, long time. And that s a disgrace. Trump may have won by getting more electoral votes, but he lost the popular vote which is a sign that Democrats can take back the White House from Trump and the Republicans in 2020 with a candidate who is more popular and has less baggage. Someone like Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris.So while Trump and the GOP and their racists voters will enjoy their victory now, they have ignited a progressive wave of rage that is going to bury them and drag them kicking and screaming into the future America deserves.Featured Image: Wikimedia', 'Comedian Roseanne Barr took to Twitter Monday to defend President Donald Trump from unspecified attacks, which she said were really \"disguised\" attacks on American voters.

Anthony ElonisThe Supreme Court struck another blow for free speech Monday, ruling that threats made over the Internet are protected unless they are malevolent or reckless.The decision was a temporary victory for Anthony Elonis and those like him whose threatening words on Facebook or similar social media sites may instill fear in their targets. But it was a defeat for the government and groups that defend victims of domestic violence.Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the decision for a near-unanimous court. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, and Justice Samuel Alito dissented in part.Elonis was 27 and recently unemployed in Pennsylvania five years ago when he began posting threats against his estranged wife and others, from a generic kindergarten class to the FBI agents who came to his door. He was convicted on four counts of transmitting threats and sentenced to 44 months in prison. He completed his term a year ago.The question that has split federal appeals courts is whether the threats must be intentional, or whether they are illegal just because a reasonable person such as those on the receiving end takes them seriously. Elonis was convicted under the latter standard; a majority of justices ruled that s not sufficient.Elonis might not be off the hook, however. The high court s ruling means his case will be sent back to a lower court to determine whether he meant what he posted or, as he claimed, was just exercising his right to artistic expression. If the court rules that his posts were intentionally threatening, his conviction will stand.The case represents a critical test of free speech in the Internet age, when words that seem threatening emanate from violent spouses and video game-players alike. The justices were seeking a rule that could result in locking up the former and letting the latter off the hook.Elonis case offered a perfect test. After his wife, Tara, left him and took their two children, he lost his job at an Allentown, Pa., amusement park and began a series of dark posts containing explicit references to violence against his wife, coworkers, kindergartners, police and the FBI.Sometimes, he imitated rap lyrics. Other times, he referred to his First Amendment rights. His lawyers said it was a form of therapy as well as art. Did you know that it s illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife? Elonis wrote in one of many posts. It s illegal. It s indirect criminal contempt. It s one of the only sentences that I m not allowed to say. The lengthy diatribe copied nearly word-for-word a satirical sketch by the Whitest Kids U Know comedy troupe, concluding with Elonis own summation: Art is about pushing limits. I m willing to go to jail for my constitutional rights.

And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation federalism unit, which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.', 'October 26, 2016 - Fort Russ - Antifashist - translated by J. Arnoldski -  Russia\\'s permanent representative to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, is sure that the bloodshed in South-East Ukraine could be avoided if the country\\'s authorities apologized to the population of the DPR and LPR like Verkhovna Rada deputy Nadezhda Savchenko proposed.  The Russian diplomat said this in commenting on the statement of the Verhkovna Rada\\'s vice speaker, Irina Gerashchenko, made at a meeting of the UN Security council in which the Kiev representative once again accused Russia of aggression against Ukraine. In addition, the Ukrainian politician called Savchenko \"the most famous prisoner of the Kremlin freed in exchange for military personnel from the Russian Army.\"  \"In her speech, Ukraine\\'s representative mentioned Nadezhda Savchenko. After being pardoned, she returned to her homeland where she stated that Kiev should apologize to the residents of Donetsk and Lugansk. It is a pity that Ukrainian authorities don\\'t have enough humanity or political courage to do so,\" Churkin said.  According to Churkin, the inter-Ukrainian crisis would have been resolved long ago if Kiev didn\\'t attempt time and time again to change the Minsk Agreements. He stressed: \"There would have been no conflict in Donbass if Kiev had not opted for armed suppression of the dissent that arose after a coup backed by foreign forces was carried out in the country.\"  Russia\\'s UN representative added that for two years already \"Ukrainian security forces have shelled residential areas of Donetsk and Lugansk, as a result of which civilians, including women and children, have been killed.\" He referred to the UN High Commissioner for Human Right\\'s report on abductions and torture to which Ukrainian forces have subjected women.

She took it upon herself to say she was totally worried about Trump becoming our president. Maybe it was visions of that orange prison jumpsuit and a jail cell that kept going through her head.She also admitted that she had no concession speech prepared. Really? That s just stupid! You paid those pollsters to lie. You must have known the truth or did you figure that no one could overcome as much election fraud as you and the Democrat Party had committed?Either way, Hillary, Donald Trump is President, you are not, and We the People are the grateful winners.The interview takes on a narcissistic tone when she describes how she had to go lie down and would scream in her pillow to get over the pain of losing the election to Trump. I would have to go lie down because it was so excruciating , she joked to interviewer Ryan Tubridy in a candid conversation, filmed near her home in Chappaqua, New York. I was in a state of shock. I had not prepared a concession speech, the former presidential candidate revealed, explaining that whilst expecting a close result, her campaign remained confident of victory up until early election night returns began to suggest otherwise. EVERYONE WAS SO CONFIDENT Following a final rally in Philadelphia, appearing with then president, Barack Obama, husband Bill Clinton and celebrities including Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, Clinton recalled that on the eve of polling day everyone was so confident. Whilst discussing the inauguration of President Trump, asked if she wanted to scream, Clinton told RT , Oh, I did. But that was a common occurrence in those days. You know, scream into the pillow when I saw what was happening. I would have been disappointed and really unhappy if I had lost to a normal Republican. But to lose to someone who I believed profoundly was not ready for the job, was temperamentally unqualified for the job was such a burden. I just thought, I ve let everybody down, I ve let my country down, I ve let the world down. How did this happen? Clinton recalled.TOSSING THE BLAME TO EVERYONE BUT HERSELF Acknowledging the role of the email scandal and various shortcomings in her campaign, Clinton also blamed Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the propagation of fake news as factors in the election of President Trump. I knew there were these other forces at work that needed to be unpacked and analyzed. It s not only about what happened, it s about preventing it from happening again, she added. SLIGHTLY WACKY GRANDMA With links to Ireland since her involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s, Clinton, who segued from imposing political figure to slightly wacky grandma according to one reviewer, told Ireland s RT Television that she was not going to let the experience turn her bitter and cynical and that she would use her platform to fight against what she saw as politically damaging trends emerging in the US.SHE NEEDS TO GO AWAY!', 'With the United Nations designating 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, there has never been a better time to be more environmentally conscious when traveling. And, it\\'s not hard to do, according to Costas Christ, the director of sustainability for the luxury travel network Virtuoso. \"Being greener on vacation doesn\\'t take a lot of effort or mean sacrificing pleasure,\" he said. Below, Mr. Christ\\'s top tips on traveling green: Book Hotels With Green Practices Many properties include green efforts on their websites, or you can ask the concierge or reservations department about the hotel\\'s green programs. \"It could be an extensive recycling program, using LED lighting or having power systems that expend less energy,\" he said. Two of his favorite properties with a green footprint include the Brando in French Polynesia, which is operated on renewable energy, and Three Camel Lodge in Mongolia, which composts its kitchen waste for use in a solar greenhouse producing fresh ingredients for the restaurant. Carry a Reusable Shopping Bag Traveling with a reusable bag is a way to avoid contributing to plastic bag pollution, a significant concern in many parts of the world. Use the bag to carry the souvenirs you buy on your trip. Locals will welcome it, too. Mr. Christ said that when he was buying fruit at a roadside stand in Belize in January, the vendor thanked him for bringing his own bag and told him it saves her money because she has to buy fewer bags for her shoppers, and it makes for less litter, too. Say \\'No\\' to Plastic Water Bottles They are readily and inexpensively available, but the waste from plastic bottles clogs up landfills and pollutes the ocean. Mr. Christ advised either taking a reusable bottle from home or asking your tour operator or hotel for one and refilling it with purified water. Transportation Can Be Green, Too. Relying on biking or walking to explore your destination helps the environment because both create minimal carbon emissions. They also give the traveler a better sense of place. If you\\'re flying to your destination, use a reputable carbon offset provider, like MyClimate, a nonprofit group that supports projects, and pick nonstop flights versus connections — fewer flights mean fewer carbon emissions. Also, go for a rental car, an option with many companies today. Hertz, for example, has the Green Traveler Collection, a fleet of hybrid cars that are affordable to rent. Eat Local Enjoying meals that emphasize local ingredients, Mr. Christ said, means fewer fossil fuels are involved because they didn\\'t travel far to reach your plate. Also, he suggested avoiding shrimp. \"Unless otherwise specified, a lot of shrimp comes from aquaculture ponds bulldozed out of tropical mangrove forests,\" he said. \"Basically, the environment was destroyed to produce that shrimp. \"', '(CNN) Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the United States has determined that ISIS\\' action against the Yazidis and other minority groups in Iraq and Syria constitutes genocide .

Kerry said that in 2014, ISIS trapped Yazidis, killed them, enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and girls, \" selling them at auction, raping them at will and destroying the communities in which they had lived for countless generations,\" executed Christians \"solely for their faith\" and also \"forced Christian women and girls into slavery.\" \"Without our intervention, it is clear that those people would have been slaughtered,\" he said. This is the first time that the United States has declared a genocide since Darfur in 2004. The House of Representatives on Monday unanimously passed a resolution labeling the ISIS atrocities against Christian groups in Syria and Iraq \"genocide,\" a term the State Department had been reluctant to use about the attacks and mass murders by the terror group. The move, aimed at ramping up pressure on the Obama administration, appears to have worked. The measure was non-binding, but both Republicans and Democrats in the House joined together 393-0 to back a \"sense of Congress\" saying the crimes committed against Christians, Yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in the region amount to war crimes and, in some cases, genocide. Republican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, whose Nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled Yazidis in the U.S., authored the resolution with California Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo. During debate on Monday, Fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has \"risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the House of Representatives.\" Under a deadline set by Congress, the State Department had until Thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designation. Kerry, though, had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of ISIS, also know as ISIL, were genocide. \"ISIL\\'s campaign of terror against the innocent, including the Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque targeted acts of violence, show all the warning signs of genocide,\" Kerry said in August 2014. \"For anyone who needed a wakeup call, this is it.\" Fortenberry praised the State Department for its decision Thursday. \"I commend Secretary Kerry and the State Department for making this important designation. The genocide against Christians, Yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities -- it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself,\" he said. \"The United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authority.\" \"That it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion, in the face of unspeakable human suffering, defies explanation,\" Rubio, who until Tuesday was a GOP presidential candidate, said in a statement. \"At long last the United States is no longer silent in the face of this evil, but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation, if the designation did not then yield some sort of action.\" \"I am very happy to hear that (the U.S.) will recognize the genocide of Yezidi and Christian minorities,\" he told CNN in an email. \"This is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups, specially ISIS. And this is also important for my community to trust the international community again, because we were left in the hands of Islamic State.\" He called on the State Department to push the U.N. to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the Yazidis and Christians in Iraq and Syria. \"Furthermore,\" he said, \"it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that (these) crimes will not happen again.\" An international center advocating against hate, terrorism and anti-Semitism was one to join the chorus. \"The Simon Wiesenthal Center applauds Secretary Kerry\\'s acknowledgement that Christians and Yazidis are targets of Genocide,\" the organization said in a statement. \"We reiterate our call that the U.S put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy ISIS.\" In Defense of Christians, a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide, put out a statement from its president Toufic Baaklini. \"IDC extends our deepest gratitude to Secretary Kerry and to the Obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against Christians, Yazidis, Shia Muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide,\" Baaklini said. And the Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, put out a statement of \"appreciation.\" \"For some time, the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by ISIS to eliminate Christians from the Middle East. For the U.S. government to call this savagery by its proper name -- genocide -- is a welcome step in what must now be a more committed effort at bringing peace and security to that beleaguered land,\" Wuerl said. \"These words must now be translated into action.\"', 'Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC \"commander-in-chief\" forum on military and veterans issues: - Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started, while Trump was wrong, once again, in saying he was against the war before it started. - Trump said that President Obama set a \"certain date\" for withdrawing troops from Iraq, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in. - Trump said that Obama\\'s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were \"the first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One\" when \"high officials\" of a host country did not appear to greet the president. Not true. - Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration. That\\'s false.

But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power. - Trump cherry-picked Clinton\\'s words when he claimed Clinton said \"vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\" Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as \"widespread\" as some Republicans claimed, but she went on to acknowledge problems, including the issue of wait times for doctors. The forum, sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was held Sept. 7 at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. Today show host Matt Lauer, and members of the military and veterans in the audience, questioned the candidates separately. Trump said he \"was totally against the war in Iraq,\" while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts don\\'t support either candidate\\'s strong assertions. Our review of Trump\\'s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact, he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept. 11, 2002 — about six months before the war started. Stern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, \"Yeah, I guess so.\" In the NBC commander in chief forum, Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started. As for Clinton, who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump \"supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.\" But just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started, the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war \"after it happened.\" The Clinton campaign cited Trump\\'s interview on March 21, 2003, with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started. Cavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war \"looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint,\" and he predicted the market will \"go up like a rocket\" after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war, and Trump doesn\\'t offer an opinion. As early as July 2003, Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris Matthews about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later, Trump told MSNBC\\'s Joe Scarborough, \"I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.\" Clinton invited her audience to read Trump\\'s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, \"Donald Trump and the Iraq War.\" Trump said President Obama set a \"certain date\" for withdrawing troops from Iraq, but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush. NBC\\'s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond, when pushed for details on his military proposals, that he\\'s not going to give details because he wants to be \"unpredictable.\" Trump responded, \"Absolutely,\" and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date. As we said then, Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: \"All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.\" In the NBC forum, Trump also called the withdrawal of troops \"a terrible decision.\" As we\\'ve explained before, Condoleezza Rice, Bush\\'s secretary of State, later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected. Once Obama took office in January 2009, he had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, to leave a residual American troop force. But Maliki still didn\\'t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, later wrote that the president didn\\'t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn\\'t a deal to be made with Maliki. So, both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a \"certain date\" for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in. It\\'s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16, 2007, interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq. Trump said that Obama\\'s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were \"the first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One\" when \"high officials\" of a host country did not appear to greet the president. That\\'s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft. Trump referred to the fact that Cuba\\'s president, Raul Castro, did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March, that Saudi Arabia\\'s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama\\'s trip to Riyadh in April, and he referred to China\\'s handling of the president\\'s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting. Whether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has. In 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China\\'s foreign minister rather than the president, whom he met only later. Similarly, on a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl. These and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post\\'s \"Fact Checker,\" who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba\\'s and Saudi Arabia\\'s handling of Obama\\'s visits were \"without precedent.\" Kessler said of Trump, \"once again he\\'s wrong, wrong, wrong.\" Kessler also noted that during Richard Nixon\\'s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country\\'s number two man, Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss, Chairman Mao, didn\\'t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house. Clinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization, which she said Trump supports. But Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. \"I would not do that,\" Trump said, referring to Clinton\\'s claim that he supports privatization. Trump\\'s campaign published \"The Goals Of Donald J. Trump\\'s Veterans Plan\" on its website last October. It doesn\\'t call for the VA to be completely privatized. One of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare. \"Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran\\'s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,\" the plan states. \"The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans\\' healthcare dollars,\" the plan says. Trump\\'s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations. Trump\\'s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law, creating a temporary program, separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program, that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital. Trump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent \"Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA\" in July. Point 10 of the plan says: \"Mr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.\" Trump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well. To be clear, Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That\\'s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans. Trump criticized Clinton for making \"a terrible mistake on Libya\" when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power. Trump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be \"prepared on Day One,\" if elected president, to tackle \"complex national security issues.\" This isn\\'t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya. During the 10th GOP debate, Trump said he had \"never discussed that subject\" when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But, as we wrote, Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya \"on a humanitarian basis\" and \"knock [Gadhafi] out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.\" Trump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011: Even though Trump now says Clinton\\'s support for intervention in Libya was a \"terrible mistake,\" it doesn\\'t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi\\'s removal. Trump twisted Clinton\\'s words when he claimed Clinton said \"vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\" Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as \"widespread\" as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim, but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system — including the issue of wait times for doctors — and what she would do to address them. Trump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as \"one of the big problems\" in the VA, and then suggested Clinton doesn\\'t think the VA has problems. Lauer interrupted, noting that Clinton \"went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.\" Trump insisted his version was accurate, adding, \"I\\'m telling you … she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.\" That\\'s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC\\'s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23, 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. \"The reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable,\" Maddow said. Maddow asked if Clinton had any \"new ideas for trying to fix\" the VA. Here was Clinton\\'s response, with the part Trump is referring to in bold. Clinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they \"want it to fail\" so they can privatize it. Clinton added, \"But we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern, so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.\" Indeed, the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to \"fundamentally reform veterans\\' health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.\" The campaign says Clinton \"was outraged by the recent scandals at the VA, and as president, she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.\" The site specifically mentions Clinton\\'s dissatisfaction that \"[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals\" and promises she will \"[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.\" Trump cherry-picked the part of Clinton\\'s response that said problems in the VA have \"not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,\" to make the blanket claim that Clinton is \"satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration\" and that \"vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\" But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton\\'s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA — including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.', 'Share on Twitter  The Republican National Committee launched a new video advertisement Thursday hitting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on her support for the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as \"Obamacare.\"  The 27-second video, which is part of a five-figure campaign on Facebook, details the recent developments surrounding increased healthcare premiums for individuals in certain states by reminding voters of Clinton\\'s support for the landmark law.  The video, obtained by Independent Journal Review, also plays Clinton\\'s quote taking credit for the Affordable Care Act\\'s framework:  \"Before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.\"  In a statement, RNC chairman Reince Priebus said, \"Hillary Clinton\\'s tone deaf promises to expand Obamacare will only mean a greater strain on the finances of many American families,\" adding:  \"Hillary Clinton has for years touted her own botched healthcare plans as the blueprint for this trainwreck of a law that was designed to fail, and the almost daily reports of skyrocketing premiums, disappearing options, and collapsing state exchanges will remain a reality if she is president.\"  Obamacare\\'s struggles have been a prominent focus for Republicans in many down-ballot races across the United States. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has touched on the issue as well, releasing a brief healthcare position paper .  Because of Clinton\\'s role in the framework and selling of the Affordable Care Act, Priebus said that voters should reject Clinton.  \"The best way to hold Hillary Clinton and Democrats in Congress accountable for this mess is to elect Donald Trump president and return Republican majorities to the House and Senate so we can pass patient-centered healthcare reform that won\\'t cripple family budgets,\" he said.', 'President Donald Trump stressed to the emir of Qatar the importance of unity in fighting terrorism, the White House said on Friday, a day after the U.S. president offered to mediate the Gulf country s dispute with its Arab neighbors.

The Trump strategy is to show that the media people are hopeful prigs, out of touch with the nation. \" And you mentioned me. You said, \"The media correspondent for CNN turns to the camera every Sunday morning and delivers a pious sermon about Trump\\'s perfidiousness. \" I hope I pronounced that right. Tell me about that particular issue. Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong, trying to fact check the president? WOLFF: I think it\\'s — and I mean this with truly no disrespect, but I think you can border on being sort of quite a ridiculous figure. It\\'s not a good look to repeatedly and defend your own . The media should not be the story. Every week in this religious sense, you make it the story. We are not the story. STELTER: There\\'s room for one hour a week on CNN for this?

The Dutch revision submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Council, circulated just in time for debate on Friday morning, called for an international eminent group of experts to carry out an inquiry. The earlier version had asked for an international commission of inquiry, the gold standard for U.N. human rights investigations since a landmark report by a U.N. commission of inquiry into North Korea in 2014. It was not immediately clear if the call for an eminent group of experts would be accepted by Saudi Arabia, which has in previous years convinced the U.N. Human Rights Council that an internal Yemeni investigation is more appropriate. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been bombing the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen since the Houthis seized much of the country s north in 2015. U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein has pleaded with the council s 47 member countries to launch an independent investigation into the war, which has killed thousands, ruined the economy and pushed millions to the brink of famine. Riyadh says the coalition is fighting terrorists and supporting Yemen s legitimate government, but Zeid s office has said Saudi-led air strikes cause the majority of civilian casualties. A panel set up by the Saudi-led coalition to investigate civilian casualties found its air strikes were largely justified. The last-minute Dutch amendment came after France, not currently a member of the council, pushed for a compromise. We are working in particular to narrow positions on the international dimension of the investigation mechanism on the violation of human rights committed in Yemen, French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne told reporters. The French statement appeared to echo Britain and the United States, which want to see consensus around a single resolution. We believe that there is room to satisfy everybody, said a French diplomatic source, denying that Paris was seeking to weaken the text. Two diplomatic sources said the Dutch had been under great pressure to back down. In a letter seen by one of the diplomats, Saudi Arabia - the world s biggest oil exporter - had warned some states of possible consequences should they support the Dutch resolution, submitted jointly with Canada, calling for a full commission. The Saudi ambassador in Geneva declined to comment on the negotiations. Earlier in the three-week council session, he said the time was not ripe for an international inquiry. The new French administration has drawn criticism over its stance in light of a ringing appeal by President Emmanuel Macron to defend human rights during his inaugural speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 20. Six major international groups, including Amnesty International, have published columns in the French press over the last week calling on Macron to do more on Yemen. By refraining from supporting efforts to advance justice in Yemen, President Macron would betray his own pledge to uphold human rights values and place lucrative arms deals with Saudi Arabia above the shattered lives of ordinary Yemenis who have endured years of war crimes, cholera and near famine, Louis Charbonneau, United Nations-based director at Human Rights Watch, said by phone. It s not too late...to finally support an international investigation on Yemen and show Macron s commitment to human rights is more than mere words.', 'A new poll by Austria s Social Democrats (SPO) suggests they may be poised for a boost at parliamentary elections on Sunday after having been relegated to third place behind the conservatives and the far right in opinion polls for months.

He was 79. His death was confirmed by his son, Ezra, who said the cause was complications of cancer. Mr. Buchla was an instrument builder, musician and composer. He conceived his instruments, including a modular synthesizer, as tools for creating previously unheard sounds and gave them names like the Music Easel, Thunder or simply the Buchla Box. His inventions were prized for the flexibility and richness of the sounds they produced and the possibilities they suggested. Mr. Buchla disliked the term \"synthesizer,\" which suggested to him a synthetic imitation of existing sounds. He was best known for the many devices he designed for his own company, Buchla Associates. But in a career, he also helped build (and sometimes ran) the Grateful Dead\\'s sound system in the 1960s, worked on NASA projects and devised early transistorized hearing aids and navigation devices for the blind. At least one sound from a Buchla instrument has been heard worldwide: the \"pop and pour\" sound created by the composer Suzanne Ciani and used in countless advertisements. In the 1960s, Mr. Buchla\\'s instruments represented what became known as the West Coast philosophy of electronic music: more experimental and less commercial, breaking away from tradition and virtuosity. \"I always figured that if I made something that was too popular, that I was doing something wrong and had best move on,\" Mr. Buchla told Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco, the authors of \"Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer\" (2002). \"And I\\'ve always enjoyed being on the edge. \" In the early \\'60s, the Robert Moog, who died in 2005, and Mr. Buchla arrived independently at the idea of the modular synthesizer: an instrument assembled from various modules that controlled one another\\'s voltages to generate and shape sounds. Voltages could control pitch, volume, attack, timbre, speed and other parameters, interacting in complex ways. Mr. Buchla began designing his first instrument in 1963, but it was not completed until 1965. The first Moog prototype was unveiled in 1964. On the East Coast, Mr. Moog built synthesizers that could be played from a keyboard, a configuration that working musicians found familiar and practical. Mr. Buchla, in San Francisco, wanted instruments that were not necessarily tied to Western scales or existing keyboard techniques. To encourage unconventional thinking, his early instruments deliberately omitted a keyboard. \"A keyboard is dictatorial,\" he said. \"When you\\'ve got a keyboard, it\\'s hard to play anything but keyboard music. \" While the modules of Moog synthesizers had straightforward names out of electrical engineering — oscillators to generate tones, filters to modify them — Mr. Buchla\\'s instruments had modules with more colorful names, like Multiple Arbitrary Function Generator, Quad Dynamics Manager and, for his noise generator, Source of Uncertainty. \"I have always been outside, and I\\'ve chosen to remain there,\" he said in a 1983 interview with Polyphony magazine. \"I\\'ve been an experimentalist since really early childhood. \" Mr. Buchla was born in South Gate, Calif. on April 17, 1937, and grew up in that state and in New Jersey. He studied piano and, discovering a knack for electronics, began building radio sets. He studied astronomy, music and physiology at the University of California, Berkeley, and graduated as a physics major in 1959. While at Berkeley, where he stayed for postgraduate study, he worked on NASA projects, including controls for the Gemini space capsule. He also developed a navigational aid for the blind for RCA and the Veterans Administration in the early 1960s. And he made music, building string instruments and sound sculptures. His composition \"Cicada Music\" (1963) calls for \"approximately 2, 500 performers. \" Mr. Buchla grew interested in musique concrète, an experimental technique using recording tape to manipulate sounds, and worked at the San Francisco Tape Music Center as both a composer and a technician. In 1965, with $500 from a Rockefeller Foundation grant made to the Tape Music Center, the composers Morton Subotnick and Ramon Sender commissioned Mr. Buchla to build his first instrument, the original Buchla Box. It included a module that would transform both and popular music. Called a sequencer, it vastly expanded the concept and functionality of a tape loop by generating and repeating a chosen series of voltages, enabling it to control a recurring melody, a rhythm track or other musical elements. It would become an essential tool of electronic dance music. Mr. Subotnick used a Buchla Series 100 Modular Electronic Music System to create \"Silver Apples of the Moon,\" a 1968 album commissioned by Nonesuch Records. The composer Vladimir Ussachevsky ordered three for the studios of the Electronic Music Center (now the Computer Music Center at Columbia University). That order led Mr. Buchla to start his instrument factory in a Berkeley storefront so small that the instruments were often assembled out on the sidewalk. The Buchla Box also supplied sound for the writer Ken Kesey\\'s Acid Tests, the freewheeling multimedia happenings at which attendees, including Mr. Buchla, used LSD. Mr. Buchla was at the electronic controls for sound and visuals at the Trips Festival in San Francisco in 1966, a pinnacle of the psychedelic era. In his book \"The Electric Acid Test\" (1968) Tom Wolfe wrote about the \"Buchla electronic music machine screaming like a logical lunatic. \" After building part of the Grateful Dead\\'s sound system in the 1960s, he sometimes mixed the band\\'s live shows, adding electronic sounds from his Buchla Box. CBS licensed Mr. Buchla\\'s designs in 1969 for a division it owned at the time, but the partnership did not last Mr. Buchla\\'s instruments were not geared toward a mass market. He returned to developing and manufacturing instruments on his own. As the 1970s began, he saw possibilities in minicomputers, inventing hybrid electronic instruments, beginning with his 200 series Electronic Music Box. Mr. Buchla was the technical director, from 1970 to 1971, at the California Institute of the Arts, designing both musical equipment and computer languages for music composition. As technical director of the Electric Symphony during that period, he used electronics to capture and extend the sounds of orchestral instruments. He introduced his portable, programmable Music Easel in 1973 and started the Electric Weasel Ensemble, a quintet of Music Easel players. He also built electronic music studios for educational institutions, including Stony Brook University on Long Island and the Norwegian Center for Electronic Music in Oslo. By the end of the 1970s, he had invented a keyboard instrument, the Touché, and an electronic cello interface. His 1982 Buchla 400 Series included a video display. Mr. Buchla was a consultant to the contemporary music organization Ircam (Institute for Research and Coordination in ) in France, and he received a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship to design instruments and write music for a electronic orchestra. During the 1990s, he turned to designing MIDI controllers, alternatives to keyboards that send signals from a physical performance to a synthesizer. One controller, the Thunder, had 50 plates that responded to contact, pressure and location another, the Lightning, had wands responding to motion and gesture. And the Marimba Lumina, played with mallets, responded to velocity, position and contact each of its four mallets could be assigned its own sound. Mr. Buchla consulted for other instrument companies, including Oberheim, for which he designed the 1995 Oberheim and Moog, which manufactured his 2002 PianoBar, which employed sensors placed on a piano\\'s keys and pedals to translate a pianist\\'s performance into MIDI signals. As the 21st century began, there was a surge of interest in modular analog synthesizers — a backlash against predictable, sterile digital sounds. Mr. Buchla revisited his 200 series from the 1970s, updating it as the 200e. Yet his business ran into financial problems, and in 2012, as Mr. Buchla struggled with cancer, he sold the company to Audio Supermarket, which changed its name to Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments and made Mr. Buchla its chief technical officer, only to fire him in 2013. Mr. Buchla had a stroke in 2014. In 2015, he sued Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments to regain control of the company, contending that he had not been fully paid for the sale, that he was terminated without good cause and that the company had failed to \"use reasonable business efforts to reach sales targets. \" The case went to arbitration in July 2015 and reached a confidential resolution this year. Besides his son, who is also a musician, Mr. Buchla is survived by his wife, Bonnel two daughters, Jeannine Serbanich and Erin Buchla and two grandchildren.', \"Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will meet with fellow Democrats in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Politico reported on Tuesday, citing Democratic sources.

Opened in 2007, it\\'s home to one of the largest casinos on earth. And it\\'s not alone: Of the 10 biggest casinos in the world in 2014 (based on revenue) a staggering eight were in Macau, a tiny region on the southern coast of China, where over half a million people are packed into fewer than 12 square miles. But I wasn\\'t there to gamble. Following a precedent I\\'d established in my very first Frugal Traveler column, when I toured Las Vegas without going to the famed Strip, I was determined to break the shell of Macau\\'s opulent exterior and see what lay beneath the surface. During a quick trip, taking the ferry across the Pearl River Estuary, I found it was the perfect place for a getaway from the noise and intense urban compactness of Hong Kong. Owing to its colonial past, Macau, with its cobblestone streets, old Catholic churches and narrow alleyways, has an almost European feel to it, along with an interesting local cuisine that fuses Portuguese and Chinese flavors. And my focus, naturally, was putting this trip together without causing undue strain on my budget. Macau was one of the first Asian settlements to be forced into the yoke of European colonization and the last to shed it, achieving full independence from Portugal in 1999. As with Hong Kong, China administers Macau but employs a somewhat approach. There are no visa requirements for Americans staying in Macau fewer than 30 days (you will need to bring your passport). The TurboJet ferry ride from Hong Kong (150 to 200 Hong Kong dollars for an economy fare, about $20 to $25) is reasonably quick and comfortable. Ferries leave from various spots in Hong Kong regularly, so if you miss one, there\\'s no need to worry. (Be more cautious when you\\'re leaving Macau — it\\'s easier to end up on the wrong ferry.) My attack plan was simple: to see as much as I could, by foot and by public transportation. Macau is traditionally divided into three sections: the peninsula and the islands of Coloane and Taipa. (A fourth \"region\" of land reclaimed from the ocean, Cotai, now connects Coloane and Taipa and is the home to many of the newer casinos.) I particularly had my eye on rustic Coloane Village in the south. Though I had no plans to indulge in the casinos, one lesson I\\'ve learned in my travels is that where there\\'s gambling, cheap rooms follow — it\\'s how they lure you in. I was able to land a very comfortable, relatively luxurious room at the Sofitel on the western side of the peninsula for 650 Hong Kong dollars, a little over $80. Close to the center of the city, it was an ideal point. I was able to check another essential off the list by walking to Yin He Dian Xun (roughly, Galaxy Telecommunications) and purchasing a SIM card from a very helpful young woman for 50 Macanese patacas (about $6). Ah, yes, the currency. The Macanese pataca and Hong Kong dollar are separate currencies but virtually interchangeable in Macau. Change will sometimes come in patacas, sometimes in Hong Kong dollars. A dollar is, however, slightly more valuable than a pataca. If you\\'re considering making a big souvenir purchase (like gold or jade jewelry, which is plentiful on the main drag of Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro) either use a credit card with no foreign transaction fee, or walk into a bank to exchange for patacas — I was able to do both without difficulty. Senado Square, within walking distance of my hotel, was a good place to begin exploring. Beautiful old yellow and pink pastel buildings with arched doorways and green shuttered windows frame the historic square, which is paved with small tiles. It was a perfect place to stroll and enjoy the egg tart I\\'d purchased for 9 dollars from Koi Kei Bakery. The egg tart is one of Macau\\'s signature delicacies, a local interpretation of the Portuguese pastel de nata — perfectly creamy custard with a pleasantly caramelized top, encased within a delicate, flaky pastry cup. Another distinctive item is the pork chop bun. I stopped into the celebrated Tai Lei Loi Kei, a nearly Macanese chain, and paid 48 dollars for a small, pork chop that had been slapped somewhat unceremoniously onto a buttered white roll. Fortunately the meat was simply seasoned and well cooked (just be careful not to break a tooth). In addition to its cuisine, Macau has memorable architecture. Catholic influence is still very much present, at least aesthetically. St. Dominic\\'s Church, a beautifully restored, structure, is free to enter, as is a art museum housed in the church\\'s bell tower. I looked over the icons and relics of the church on display, including beautiful old wooden carvings. Other worthy architectural attractions include the Ruins of St. Paul, a grand stone facade that is one of the few remaining pieces of a complex. While there, I made the steep hike up to the adjacent Fortaleza do Monte, which provided an excellent view of the city. I could walk to the ruins and St. Dominic\\'s from my hotel, but despite Macau\\'s compact size, not everything is walkable. I would not recommend driving in Macau, nor riding one of the city\\'s ubiquitous scooters. I found a bike rental shop called Si Toi in Taipa that charged 20 dollars per hour (only $2. 50, remember) but I ultimately decided on the bus: I found it cheap and fairly reliable. Unless you have something called a Macaupass (which I did not, and purchase locations are annoyingly scarce) you will need coins. Lots of coins. And they don\\'t make change on the buses, so get used to walking around with a pocketful of patacas. (Local businesses and banks can help you make change if you\\'re hard up.) I hopped the 26A bus to Coloane, eager to see the rustic, more peaceful side of Macau. (A quick note on signage: Every official sign in Macau will be in both Portuguese and Chinese. I found this somewhat curious, as I didn\\'t hear a word of Portuguese my entire stay. I asked Neal, a server at the cute Cafe Cheri, if he spoke Portuguese or knew anyone who did. \"Well,\" he hesitated, \"No, not really. \" Did anyone in Macau speak Portuguese? \"Yes, I think in some restaurants. \") Coloane Village was quiet, almost sleepy, when I hopped off the bus by the roundabout near Eanes Park. It was, in other words, exactly what I was seeking. I began walking north up the coast, stopping for another excellent egg tart at Lord Stow\\'s Bakery. Colorfully painted houses stood on stilts in the bay, China a mere 1, 000 feet to the west. Fishermen hung their catch outside their homes, and every now and then there was the distinctive clack of tiles. I wound my way down Avenida de Cinco de Outubro, in the shade of ficus rumphii trees with aerial roots, like banyan trees. I eventually found myself in a beautiful cobblestone plaza with a fountain on one end and the beautiful, bright yellow Chapel of St. Francis on the other. I dined al fresco at Cafe Nga Tim on a dish of rice and curried prawns and watched evening set in. The casinos? Didn\\'t need them. They do provide a useful benefit, though: When it came time to head back to the ferry terminal, I happily used the hotel\\'s free shuttle bus.', 'Remember when Michelle Obama told an adoring crowd at the DNC Convention how she had to suffer through living in the White House that was built by slaves ?Remember in 2015, when President Barack Obama used the n word during an interview where he talked about racism in America, and actually tried to convince the host that blacks are victims of racism today, as much as they were 200-300 years ago.Barack Obama invoked the most charged racial slur in American society during an interview published on Monday, as part of an argument that while the US has made great strides toward equality, racism still pervades the nation. Racism, we are not cured of it. And it s not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public. That s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not, Obama told comedian Marc Maron, who interviewed the president for his popular podcast on Friday and released their conversation online on Monday. It s not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don t, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior. The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives, he continued, that casts a long shadow and that s still part of our DNA that s passed on. Watch:Well, it appears that lifetime victims, Barack and Michelle Obama have finally broken the chains of oppression that have been holding them back since they moved from their mansion in Chicago in 2008, to the White House, and then to their multi-million pad in DC, as they set their sites on 2 separate pieces of VACANT land on Martha s Vineyard valued at $12 million and $15 million each.Word around the island is that the Obamas, who ve rented a place on the Vineyard for the past several summers, are looking to buy. The former first family has many friends on Martha s Vineyard Harvard professors Henry Louis Skip Gates and Charles Ogletree, and former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, to name just a few and they would like to own a place of their own on the island.The 44th president and his wife, Michelle, are believed to be focused up island, looking at homes or buildable lots in the rural communities of Aquinnah, Chilmark, and West Tisbury. (It s worth noting that the Obamas have always rented up island, including for a two-week stay this summer.)No one s talking, least of all realtors, but we re told that one property that may be getting a long look is a magnificent waterfront outpost in Aquinnah owned by Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg. A few years ago, the couple, who inherited from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the 377-acre Red Gate Farm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, subdivided the property and put two parcels on the market.Both are still available but they don t come cheap. Sotheby s International Realty is listing a 75-acre parcel for $15 million, and a second 40-acre parcel for $12 million.The listing broker, George Ballantyne of Gibson Sotheby s International Realty, declined to talk to us. The properties appear on multiple sites, including Hancock Real Estate and Sand Piper Realty, which are both located on the Vineyard. Boston Globe', 'Habeas Corpus for Animals???The animal personhood movement believes dolphins, great apes, and elephants deserve to be able to sue and now it has a plaintiff.A New York judge has ordered the state to justify why two chimpanzees allegedly kept at a Long Island public university and used as research subjects shouldn t be transferred to an animal sanctuary in south Florida.The animal rights advocates representing the animals hailed the judge s decision late Monday to grant a hearing early next month as a watershed moment for their long and controversial effort to persuade courts to confer human rights on primates.It wasn t as big a victory for animal rights fanatics as initially thought:The judge, according to [a spokesman for the state court system], mistakenly labeled her order a writ of habeas corpus, saying she had only granted the hearing to discuss the legal issues raised by the Nonhuman Rights Project. Judge [Barbara] Jaffe on Tuesday amended her initial order, striking out the words habeas corpus from the document.That s how progressivism works. They push the envelope as far as they can. If people scream with laughter or in horror, they pull it back a little. Then, after the barrage of liberal propaganda we are relentlessly assailed with from every direction has had a little more time to work on us, they push the envelope forward again.For their part the animal rights kooks are not backing down:The organization isn t challenging the conditions of their confinement, but the confinement itself. In a petition last month, the group described the animals as autonomous and self-determining beings who should be protected by the common law of habeas corpus, a right granted only to legal persons. Give Obama a few more years to stack the courts with left-wing zealots. Not only will monkeys, dogs, and goldfish have habeas corpus rights, they will be entitled to vote and collect welfare or rather, their human companions will be entitled to on their behalf.Why not? According to liberal ideology, souls do not exist, and there is no moral difference between a human and an animal.', 'Farm owner arrested for protesting Dakota Access Pipeline\\'s theft of her land   Vicki Batts Tags: eminent domain , Dakota Access Pipeline , civil liberties (NaturalNews) There have been countless stories across the web that have documented those struggling to fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Native Americans, farmers, ranchers, landowners and environmental activists have joined together to oppose the pipeline and bring the project to a grinding halt.Just recently, 127 Native American activists were arrested at a construction site near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota. Despite the corporate media\\'s attempts to suppress information surrounding the controversial pipeline, concerns about the Dakota Access project have become increasingly visible.However, one issue has remained in the dark: the government\\'s abuse of eminent domain.Eminent domain is what gives the government the right to seize private, law-abiding citizens\\' properties for public use. Normally this means a road, a school or another public structure that will be used by the citizens of a town or which in some way serves them. However, the government can also seize private land if they can prove that it will provide some sort of \"public good.\" This loophole – and yes, it is a loophole – has allowed our government to steal land from taxpayers for years, and then give it to a private citizen or company. Such is the case with the Dakota Access Pipeline.This pipeline is not a public project; it is being conducted by a private company that will profit off their endeavors. And yet, in spite of all the land that will be destroyed and the people whose lives will be disrupted by this project, the government has still seen fit to steal land and give it to the pipeline\\'s creators under the guise of \"public good.\"In Iowa, a major conflict between farmers and the government has broken out. You see, the state government is trying to take their land, and consequently, their livelihoods, to make way for the pipeline .The state\\'s decision to hand over land owned by farmers to the Dakota Access LLC has been met with quite a lot of opposition – as it should have. Just last week, Calhoun County farmer Cyndy Coppola was arrested on her own property for protesting the government\\'s usurpation of her own land .Apparently, they expected farmers to idly sit back and watch them steal what they worked so hard for.Cyndy Coppola\\'s arrest has been ignored by the mainstream media, probably because it doesn\\'t align with their narrative that Big Government knows best. An injurious move at best, her arrest highlights everything wrong with the way our government is being run.The theft of privately owned land simply cannot be ignored any longer – it is unconstitutional for the government to give a tax-paying citizen\\'s land to a multi-billion dollar energy company so that they can make even more money. And it won\\'t just be the oil and gas companies that profit off this disgusting display of government; dozens of big banks and investment firms will also be taking home a piece of the pie. Food and Water Watch reported in September than 17 financial institutions loaned Dakota Access LLC a whopping $2.5 billion to launch their project. They noted that banks have also given a substantial number of resources to the Energy Transfer Family of companies, such as billion-dollar credit lines and revolving credits. In total, a staggering 38 banks have given this corporation over $10 billion in loans and credits.How many of those banks do you think have ties to our government? Goldman Sachs is on the list, as are several other infamous industry names.If you think the pipeline is being constructed to better our country, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s being constructed to make money for a group of elitist corporations – and they plan on taking down anyone and anything that stands in their way. Sources:', 'President Donald Trump on Wednesday told workers that they would win under his tax plan, saying it would help the middle class and boost the economy, though critics say it would mainly benefit corporations and the rich. Speaking in an airplane hangar at a Pennsylvania Air National Guard base in Harrisburg with a trailer truck behind him, Trump reiterated the basic points of the nine-page tax cut \"framework\" he unveiled two weeks ago. \"It\\'s a middle-class bill. That\\'s what we\\'re thinking of. That\\'s what I want,\" Trump said. \"I\\'ve had rich friends of mine come up to me, and say, \\'Donald, you\\'re doing this tax plan — we don\\'t want anything. ... Don\\'t give it to us. Give it to the middle class.\\' And that\\'s what we\\'re trying so hard to do,\" he said. His remarks came as new Reuters/Ipsos polling showed that more than three-quarters of Americans say the wealthiest Americans should pay more in taxes. The poll found 53 percent of adults \"strongly agree\" and 23 percent \"somewhat agree\" that the wealthiest Americans should pay higher tax rates. The Sept. 29-Oct. 5 poll of 1,504 people has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of plus or minus 6 percentage points. Financial markets have rallied strongly since Trump\\'s November 2016 election victory, driven partly by expectations that he would cut taxes for businesses, although policy analysts have been skeptical that he would do so. Trump on Wednesday boasted about the rally in markets. \"The stock market is soaring to record levels, boosting pensions and retirement accounts for hard-working Americans. Their values are going up every single day,\" he said. Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said he was a \"little bit discouraged\" about the prospects for federal tax reform. Given the difficulties Congress has had in passing laws this year, Williams, in comments following a speech in Salt Lake City, said he is \"losing confidence\" that any tax reform will be passed in the next six months or so. Trump said his plan for cutting corporate taxes could boost wage growth and mean a $4,000 pay raise for the average household, citing research from a White House economic council. Democrats, who oppose Trump\\'s plan, dispute such claims. \"I have not seen any evidence that even comes remotely close to that,\" Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said of the $4,000 calculation at a forum on Wednesday in Washington. Independent analysts have said Trump\\'s blueprint would provide uneven tax relief, add significantly to the federal budget deficit, and in some cases, benefit the very wealthy. For instance, taxpayers in the highest 1 percent of incomes, making more than $730,000 annually, would get about half of the total benefit from Trump\\'s plan, with after-tax incomes rising an average of 8.5 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based nonprofit tax think tank. Trump on Wednesday said his framework would provide a $500 tax credit to \"those who care for an adult dependent or elderly loved one\" and that it would substantially increase the child tax credit. No details on those items have been made public. Congressional tax writers in the House and Senate are working to fill in the details of Trump\\'s framework. Republican leaders hope to pass a bill by January, delivering what would be Trump\\'s first legislative victory a year into his presidency. Before that can happen, the Senate and House must open a procedural path for tax legislation by passing a budget resolution. Lawmakers have hoped to do that this month. CORPORATE, PASS-THROUGH CUTS The tax framework, developed in secret by a select group of senior Republicans known as the Big Six, calls for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and creating a new category for pass-through income earned by partners and sole proprietors, which would be taxed at 25 percent, instead of the 39.6 percent top individual rate currently paid by some. It proposes cutting the top individual rate to 35 percent, but congressional tax writers may opt to create an additional, higher rate for the highest earners. The plan also proposes eliminating the 40 percent tax on inherited estate assets worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for a married couple. A highly placed Republican operative who used to work with senior leadership on Capitol Hill said he did not expect the estate tax repeal to be included in a final package, because the proposal would greatly benefit Trump himself and his family, which would leave the tax reform effort and Trump open to Democratic attack. He said many Republicans do not see estate tax repeal as crucial, but Republicans have promised wealthy supporters for years that the tax, which they call the \"death tax,\" will end. Trump on Wednesday offered a different view. Republicans will end \"the crushing, horrible, and unfair estate tax,\" he said.

Socialists in America have had their day, all the Marxists and Communists within the Democrat party have torn the country apart.  Eight long burdensome years of Obama, overspending on socialist pet projects, controlling, politically correct, gays, feminists, transexuals, inhibiting free speech, encouraging global chaos and people have had enough.  One can only hope that Black Lives Matter is buried under deep concrete never to be seen again, all the SJWs are taken out into the streets and beaten with bats, and the politically correct morons are told to shut the fuck up once and for all.  The silent Americans seething for eight long years fought back, and to vote for someone like Trump was a breath of fresh air even though in an act of defiance against the whole system of corruption.  As one maverick to another, there can only be an element of respect given to Trump, who just did not give a fuck, and has in one night buried eight years of hell under Obama, possibly the worst president of the United States ever encountered.  It has to be said that eight years of blackness has ended, and we can all breathe a breath of fresh air and light, albeit with major uncertainties.

I can be proud of America once again all the way from Belgium!', 'A group of states renewed their effort on Monday to block President Donald Trump\\'s revised temporary ban on refugees and travelers from several Muslim-majority countries, arguing that his executive order is the same as the first one that was halted by federal courts. Court papers filed by the state of Washington and joined by California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon asked a judge to stop the March 6 order from taking effect on Thursday. An amended complaint said the order was similar to the original Jan. 27 directive because it \"will cause severe and immediate harms to the States, including our residents, our colleges and universities, our healthcare providers, and our businesses.\" A Department of Justice spokeswoman said it was reviewing the complaint and would respond to the court. A more sweeping ban implemented hastily in January caused chaos and protests at airports. The March order by contrast gave 10 days\\' notice to travelers and immigration officials. Last month, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle halted the first travel ban after Washington state sued, claiming the order was discriminatory and violated the U.S. Constitution. Robart\\'s order was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Trump revised his order to overcome some of the legal hurdles by including exemptions for legal permanent residents and existing visa holders and taking Iraq off the list of countries covered. The new order still halts citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days but has explicit waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the country. Refugees are still barred for 120 days, but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from Syria. Washington state has now gone back to Robart to ask him to apply his emergency halt to the new ban. Robart said in a court order Monday that the government has until Tuesday to respond to the states\\' motions. He said he would not hold a hearing before Wednesday and did not commit to a specific date to hear arguments from both sides. Separately, Hawaii has also sued over the new ban. The island state, which is heavily dependent on tourism, said the executive order has had a \"chilling effect\" on travel revenues. In response to Hawaii\\'s lawsuit, the Department of Justice in court papers filed on Monday said the president has broad authority to \"restrict or suspend entry of any class of aliens when in the national interest.\" The department said the temporary suspensions will allow a review of the current screening process in an effort to protect against terrorist attacks. There is a hearing in the Hawaii case set for Wednesday, the day before the new ban is set to go into effect. The first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving \"standing,\" which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy. With so many exemptions, legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals who would have a right to sue, in the eyes of a court. To overcome this challenge, the states filed more than 70 declarations of people affected by the order including tech businesses Amazon and Expedia, which said that restricting travel hurts their revenues and their ability to recruit employees. Universities and medical centers that rely on foreign doctors also weighed in, as did religious organizations and individual residents, including U.S. citizens, with stories about separated families. But the Trump administration in its filings in the Hawaii case on Monday said the carve-outs in the new order undercut the state\\'s standing claims. \"The Order applies only to individuals outside the country who do not have a current visa, and even as to them, it sets forth robust waiver provisions,\" the Department of Justice\\'s motion said. The government cited Supreme Court precedent in arguing that people outside the United States and seeking admission for the first time have \"no constitutional rights\" regarding their applications. If the courts do end up ruling the states have standing to sue, the next step will be to argue that both versions of the executive order discriminate against Muslims. \"The Trump Administration may have changed the text of the now-discredited Muslim travel ban, but they didn\\'t change its unconstitutional intent and effect,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Monday. While the text of the order does not mention Islam, the states claim that the motivation behind the policy is Trump\\'s campaign promise of \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" He later toned down that language and said he would implement a policy of \"extreme vetting\" of foreigners coming to the United States. The government said the courts should only look at the text of the order and not at outside comments by Trump or his aides.', 'Breaking all the breaking noise from the leftist media!

Fourth we would like to thank the American voter who was smart and ignored all the noise and hate against Donald Trump! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! MAKE EUROPE GREAT AGAIN!', \"The Trump administration may undertake trade actions to protect the U.S. semiconductor, shipbuilding and aluminum industries, citing national security concerns, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Tuesday. He said those industries could qualify for protection under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which lets the president impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security and was used to launch a probe of steel imports, the Journal reported. Last week, President Donald Trump launched a trade probe against China and other exporters of cheap steel into the U.S. market, raising the possibility of new tariffs. Ross said the Trump administration might intercede to aid Toshiba Corp's U.S. unit Westinghouse Electric Co, which filed for bankruptcy last month. The company filed for bankruptcy protection after it incurred billions of dollars of cost overruns at four nuclear reactors under construction in the U.S. Southeast. The bankruptcy cast doubt on the future of the first new U.S. nuclear power plants in three decades. Ross said renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement should be completed by the end of 2017, the Journal reported. Ross told the newspaper that if the talks with Mexico and Canada go much beyond December, it would be difficult to get the pact ratified by Mexico. Mexico is due to hold its presidential election in July 2018. Ross said the Trump administration was considering restarting talks on bilateral trade deals with the European Union and China that the Obama administration had begun but never finished, the Journal reported, adding that he said the United States might reopen a bilateral deal with South Korea. Earlier this month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told business leaders in Seoul that the Trump administration would review and reform the five-year-old free trade agreement between the two countries. Pence said the U.S. trade deficit had more than doubled in the five years since the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement began and there were too many barriers for U.S. businesses in the country.\")\n",
