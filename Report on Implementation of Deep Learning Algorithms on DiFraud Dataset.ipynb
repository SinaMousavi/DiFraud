    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this task is to evaluate the performance of different deep learning algorithms on the DiFraud dataset, which is available on Hugging Face. DiFraud is designed to detect fraudulent activities, and we aim to compare the effectiveness of various models in identifying these activities. id## =10%nl\n",

    "- ## 2.1 Description\n",
    "The DiFraud dataset contains records of transactions labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. The features include various attributes of the transactions that are relevant for detectin In the first step of doing this task I checked the description of this dataset on Huggingface to know more about this dataset. Each subdirectory of the dataset contains the individual dataset split into three files: train.jsonl, test.jsonl, and validation.jsonl. The splits are: train=80%, test=10%, and validation=10%.\n",
    "First I tried to read the dataset by this line of code: **\"dataset = load_dataset('difraud')\"** but due to various restrictions and policies in Iran's Internet, I couldn't download the data using this API. So I decided to download and read the dataset in the code manually. Unfortunately, the same issue exist with tools like ChatGPT or other AI tools since our IP address and location have been blocked by these services, even if we use a vpn or a proxy.  \n",

    "After downloading the dataset I converted the **.jsonl** format file to **.csv** by using a Python code so that I could work and check the files easier in csv format. The code for converting the files can be seen in the first cell of Jupyter notebook file for each subdirectory. Then I wrote a code to check if I can see the content of each file and also what are the contents.on3oding.\n",

    "After importing libraries, loading the datasets, defining some constants, tokenizing the text data, converting text to sequences, padding sequences, and converting labels to Numpy arrays, we build the model. A Sequential model is created. An **Embedding** layer maps each word to a 128-dimensional vector. Two **Conv1D** layers with ReLU activation extract features from the sequences. Then **MaxPooling1D** layer reduces the sequence length by downsampling. After that, **GlobalMaxPooling1D** layer reduces the sequence to a single vector. A **Dense** layer with 128 units and ReLU activation is added. Finally, a final **Dense** layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation outputs the probability for binary classification.\n",
    "The model is compiled with the **Adam optimizer** and binary crossentropy loss function. For this model, **Accuracy** is used as the evaluation metric.\n",

I wanted to remove it from the code but since running the cells would take so much time and it wasn't a big deal, I left it as it is.)\n",

    "For some datasets the accuracy was about 98 or 96 percent. However, for some of the datasets(e.g Political Statements) the accuracy was so low(about 60%) so I tried to improve the model by increasing the epochs and also using **GloVe** embeddings. *GloVe* (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. GloVe embeddings are pre-trained on large datasets and can be used to initialize the embedding layer of neural networks for various natural language processing tasks. I used *glove.6B.100d.txt* for my code and wrote a code segment for reading this file. However, after I used all this methods, the model didn't improved significantly. I think several conclusions and possibilities can be inferred. The dataset with higher accuracy might have higher quality data with clear and distinguishable features, while the dataset with lower accuracy might have more noise or ambiguous features. A conclusion is that, the underlying distributions of the two high and low accuracy datasets might be significantly different. The model might be better suited to the distribution of the dataset with higher achieved accuracy. Also, the dataset with 60% accuracy might be more diverse, presenting more challenging cases that the model finds difficult to handle. ANother possible reason is Overfitting and Underfitting.\n",
    "The explanation for the GloVe file code segment:\n",
    "The function reads the GloVe file line by line. Each line contains a word followed by its embedding coefficients. The word is stored in *word*, and its coefficients are stored in *coefs*. **embeddings_index** dictionary maps each word to its corresponding embedding vector. Then, an embedding matrix of zeros is initialized with shape **(len(word_index) + 1, embedding_dim)**. **len(word_index) + 1** accounts for the fact that indices are 1-based (0 is reserved for padding). For each word in **word_index** the GloVe embedding vector for the word is retrieved from **embeddings_index**. If the word has a corresponding GloVe embedding, it is placed in the **embedding_matrix** at the position corresponding to the word's index. Finally, it is used in the model. It is used in **weights=[embedding_matrix]**. This initializes the embedding layer with GloVe embeddings. **embedding_matrix** is the matrix created earlier, where each row corresponds to the GloVe vector for a word. By using this embedding layer setup, the model's performance can be improved since these embeddings capture a lot of semantic meaning from a large corpus of text. However, it didn't improve model's accuracy for some datasets."
