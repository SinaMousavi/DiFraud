Here\\'s what some others have had to say about Fiorina\\'s disastrous tenure at HP: \"A consummate self-promoter, Fiorina was busy pontificating on the lecture circuit and posing for magazine covers while her company floundered.

For the reasons set out below, I request that these comments be removed from the manuscript. Regards, Steve McIntyre ----- Original Message ----- From: [1]Steve McIntyre To: [2]David Randall Cc: [3]Scott Rutherford ; [4]Paul Kushner ; [5]Cindy Carrick ; [6]Ross McKitrick Sent: Tuesday, December 28, 2004 1:48 PM Subject: Rutherford et al. [2004] Dear Dr. Randall, Recently, at the website [7]www.realclimate.org, Michael Mann publicized a submission by Rutherford et al. to Journal of Climate, entitled Proxy-based Northern Hemisphere Surface Temperature Reconstructions: Sensitivity to Method, Predictor Network, Target Season, and Target Domain. This paper contains some untrue statements and mischaracterizations regarding criticisms we (McIntyre and McKitrick) made of Mann et al. (1998) [MBH98] in a 2003 paper and subsequent exchanges under the auspices of Nature. We are writing to request that these untrue statements be removed from the paper before any further processing of the document by Journal of Climate takes place. First, Rutherford et al. states that McIntyre and McKitrick [2003] used an incorrect version of the Mann et al. (1998) proxy indicator dataset. The history of this matter is summarized below (all relevant emails and other documentation are available at [8] . In April 2003, we requested from Mann the FTP location of the dataset used in MBH98. Mann advised me that he was unable to recall the location of this dataset and referred the request to Rutherford. Rutherford eventually directed us to a file (pcproxy.txt) located at a URL at Manns FTP site. In using this data file, we noticed numerous problems with it, not least with the principal component series. We sought specific confirmation from Mann that this dataset was the one used in MBH98; Mann said that he was too busy to respond to this or any other inquiry. Because of the many problems in this data set, we undertook a complete new re-collation of the data, using the list of data sources in the SI to MBH98 and using original archived versions wherever possible. After publication of McIntyre and McKitrick [2003], Mann said that dataset at his FTP site to which we had been referred was an incorrect version of the data and that this version had been prepared especially for me; through a blog, he provided a new URL which he now claimed to contain the correct data set. The file creation date of the incorrect version was in 2002, long prior to my first request for data, clearly disproving his assertion that it was prepared in response to my request. Mann and/or Rutherford then deleted this incorrect version with its date evidence from his FTP site. It is false and misleading for Rutherford et al. to now allege that we used the wrong dataset. We used the dataset they directed us to at their FTP site. More importantly, for our analysis, to avoid the problems with the principal component series, we re-collated the tree ring data identified in MBH98 from ITRDB archives, calculated fresh principal component series; in addition, we re-collated other proxy data from archived versions wherever possible. Thus, our own calculations were not affected by the errors in the supplied file as we did NOT use the incorrect version in our calculations. To suggest otherwise, as is done in Rutherford et al [2004], is highly misleading. To date, no source code or other evidence has been provided to fully demonstrate that the incorrect version (now deleted) did not infect some of Manns and Rutherfords other work. In this respect, we note that the now deleted file pcproxy.txt occurs in a legend in a graphic at Rutherfords website, indicating possible use elsewhere by Rutherford of the incorrect version. Accordingly, we request that the above claim be removed from the manuscript. Secondly, Rutherford et al. [2004] argues that the difference between MBH98 results and MM03 results occurs because of our misunderstanding of a stepwise procedure in MBH98 for the calculation of principal component series for tree ring networks. Again, this claim is misleading on its face. While our 2003 paper did not implement the (then undisclosed) stepwise procedure, as soon as this matter was raised in subsequent correspondence in November 2003, we implemented it and we continued to observe the discrepancies in principal component series and final results. The current manuscript ignores a refereed exchange at Nature in which we specifically clarified (in response to a reviewers question) that we had obtained such results while using the exact stepwise procedure described in MBH98. Mann is aware of this refereed exchange. The reason for the difference between our results and MBH98 results is primarily due to the fact that the tree ring principal component series in MBH98 cannot be replicated using a conventional principal components method. The MBH98 principal component series can only be replicated by standardizing on a short segment a procedure nowhere mentioned in MBH98 and only recently acknowledged in the SI to the Corrigendum of Mann et al. [Nature 2004] in response to our concerns on the subject expressed to Nature. In effect, MBH98 did not use a conventional centered PC calculation, but used an uncentered PC calculation on de-centered data. The impact of this method is the subject of ongoing controversy, which is well-known to the authors, but the existence of the method in MBH98 is no longer in doubt. In discussions of PC calculations in 2004 exchanged with the authors through Nature, we implemented the stepwise procedures of MBH98 referred to in the present manuscript and demonstrated that important differences remain even with stepwise procedures, as long as the uncentered and decentered methods of MBH98 are used. The differences in PC series resulting from using centered and uncentered series has been fully agreed to by all parties in the Nature exchange, although the parties continue to disagree on the ultimate effect on final NH temperature calculations. Accordingly, the discussion in Rutherford et al. [2004] is very incomplete and misleading in this respect. While we recognize that Mann et al. have argued that they can salvage MBH98-type results using alternative methodologies (e.g. increasing the number of PC series used in the 1400-1450 period), these salvage efforts are themselves a matter of controversy and do not validate the claims being put forward in the Rutherford et al. paper. Accordingly we ask that this claim also be deleted from the manuscript.

Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he\\'s too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season. Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday\\'s game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday\\'s game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week\\'s loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England\\'s quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears\\' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. Martin Gramatica , K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday\\'s game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01 Dunn\\'s status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook\\'s status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona\\'s third receiver. Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. Joe Horn , WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland\\'s No. 1 tight end while he is out. Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17. Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week\\'s game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.

This spring, as Trump flew to campaign rallies around the country aboard his trademark private jet, the state of New York filed a tax warrant to try to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes from the Trump-owned company that owns the Boeing 757.

The self-proclaimed billionaire, who has so far refused to release his tax returns, was one of many wealthy individuals and businesses who used a loophole in a program intended to help smaller companies in lower Manhattan recover after the Sept. 11 tragedy.

This is largely because imports under Trump\\'s policy would become more expensive, sending the price of competing American-made goods higher as well. That would effectively levy a consumption tax on purchases and cut into the incomes of shoppers.\" [CNN, 5/19/16 ] TRUMP THINKS FERGUSON AND OAKLAND ARE DANGEROUS LIKE IRAQ: \"So what\\'s the most dangerous place Trump has been? \\'Brooklyn,\\' Trump replied, joking.

That could be ending soon. Sam Clovis, the national co-chair and policy director of Trump\\'s campaign, outlined for Inside Higher Ed the ideas that the presumptive GOP nominee is preparing to put forth. While final decisions have not been made on when the ideas will be formally unveiled, not to mention many details worked out, Clovis said the Trump campaign expects higher education to be a major issue in the fall general election. Some of the ideas under consideration could be \\'revolutionary,\\' Clovis said. Proposals currently being prepared would upend the current system of student loans, force all colleges to share the risk of such loans and make it harder for those wanting to major in the liberal arts at nonelite institutions to obtain loans. And even if some of the proposals would face a skeptical Congress, these ideas could gain considerable attention if Trump uses them to parry with his Democratic opponent.\" [Inside Higher Ed, 5/13/16 ] Trump Opposed Proposals For Free Community College And Free Higher Education. \"Clovis is a tenured professor of economics at Morningside College, a small private college in Iowa, who is currently on leave to work for the Trump campaign. Some of Clovis\\'s recent pronouncements on Trump policies have been widely criticized by Washington experts as unworkable or unrealistic. And Clovis said he expects some higher education leaders to react the same way as Trump outlines these ideas in the fall campaign. He said the campaign remains open to ideas as long as they put the emphasis on student success in ways that have more impact than efforts of past administrations. First off, Clovis made clear that the Trump campaign will fight and not endorse Hillary Clinton\\'s proposal for debt-free public higher education or the Bernie Sanders plan for free public higher education. The response on those ideas will be \\'unequivocally no,\\' Clovis said. \\'How do you pay for that? It\\'s absurd on its surface.\\' Further, Trump will also reject President Obama\\'s proposals for a state-federal partnership to make community college free for new high school graduates.

Local banks should be lending to local students, he said, but colleges should be playing a role in determining loan worthiness on factors that go beyond family income. Further, he said that all colleges should have \\'skin in the game\\' and share the risk associated with student loans. Many in Congress (and not just Republicans) have voiced support for that idea. But many Democrats have argued that some institutions -- historically black colleges or community colleges, for example -- should be exempt, given their histories of educating many students from low-income families who may not have the financial resources of others. But Clovis said that the principle of colleges sharing risk must apply to all institutions.\" [Inside Higher Ed, 5/13/16 ] The Trump Campaign Planned Student Loan Reforms To Allow Colleges And Banks To Make Loan Decisions Based On Students\\' Majors And Likely Future Earnings. \"Many of the ideas on which the Trump campaign is working involve a complete overhaul of the federal student loan system, moving the government out of lending and restoring that role to private banks, as was the case before President Clinton partially and President Obama fully shifted loan origination from private lenders to the government... Further, he said that the risk needs to be substantial enough to change the way colleges decide whether to admit students, and which programs they offer. Clovis said he hoped many colleges would continue to provide remediation for those unprepared for college-level work, although he said that he preferred the term \\'student success programs\\' to remediation. But he said that colleges should not be admitting students that they aren\\'t confident can graduate in a reasonable time frame and find jobs. That means a shift in who is involved in deciding on student loans, with less emphasis on parent contributions and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and more of \\'a partnership\\' between the student, the bank and the college. \\'We think if the college has real skin in the game, it will change its model.\\' And these reforms would make it legitimate for colleges and banks to make decisions in part on students\\' prospective majors and their likely earnings after graduation, he said. \\'If you are going to study 16th-century French art, more power to you. I support the arts,\\' Clovis said. \\'But you are not going to get a job.\\' A college should factor that in when deciding on a student\\'s loan eligibility, and the requirement that colleges share the risk would be a powerful incentive to do so, Clovis added. \\'If you get into the esoteric aspects of a particular art field, you have to know that those are the circumstances,\\' he said. And Clovis said this does not mean the Trump campaign is against the liberal arts. \\'The liberal arts education is the absolute foundation to success in life,\\' Clovis said, adding that he hoped business and engineering and health professions and education students would include liberal arts courses in their college educations.

Clovis did not comment on those investigations per se, but said that one idea the campaign might propose would be to move the Education Department\\'s Office for Civil Rights to join the civil rights division of the Department of Justice. \\'Once we get into office, we\\'re going to take a hard look at the Department of Education,\\' he said. \\'There are lots of things that serve people well, but there are many operations that do not.

Manafort, who was brought on board early last month as a convention manager, was originally tasked with trying to secure Trump the necessary delegates to avoid a fight at the Republican convention. With Trump now the likely presumptive nominee for the GOP, Manafort\\'s new role is a natural growth of the campaign as they begin to build a team ready for the general election, according to the sources. The role is an obvious promotion for Manafort, but sources stressed it should not be seen as a demotion for campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.

Pyongyang has declared that it would be prepared to enter into arms control negotiations with the United States as a fellow nuclear weapons state. The United States would have to acknowledge Pyongyang\\'s nuclear weapons status, cease sanctions, end the nuclear umbrella over Japan and South Korea, end criticism of the North\\'s human rights abuses, and have the president personally guarantee these commitments in an agreement with the North Korean leader. These have been the North\\'s demands since at least 2002, when I was with our delegation as we confronted the regime with evidence of its cheating on the previous Agreed Framework. Our allies would lose confidence in extended deterrence. If the plan is to get Tokyo and Seoul to go nuclear, this would be an effective shortcut. In the past, Trump said he would be open to this, but I doubt he really meant it. Kim would control the reality show. Kim Jong Un does not do summits outside of North Korea, even with erstwhile ally China. And as Madeleine Albright, Jimmy Carter, and numerous other leaders have found, Kim will stage-manage the show to ensure maximum propaganda advantage for his regime. The narrative would be that of a tribute mission to the Great Marshall. This is not like holding the Miss Universe contest in Moscow. The summit would cause despair for millions of suffering North Koreans. North Korea\\'s horrific human rights record has finally seen a growing crescendo of criticism, including a damning report by a United Nations commission of inquiry, U.S. legislation, and greater pressure from Asia and Europe.

Trump\\'s vow to restore what he says is America\\'s lost luster, while perhaps not as flowery, comes with campaign promises that are equally grandiose. But Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has typically provided scant details on how he might make good on his promises - and ambitious ideas, even the concrete kind, do not always add up. Central to Mr. Trump\\'s campaign, and to his national security strategy, is his intent to clamp down on illegal immigration, using a vast deportation \\'force\\' to relocate people to the other side of a wall, funded by Mexico, that would stretch nearly the length of the southern border. Mr. Trump has suggested he will flesh out his ideas in a forthcoming speech. But experts across many fields who have analyzed his plans so far warn that they would come at astronomical costs - whoever paid - and would in many ways defy the logic of science, engineering and law. Mass deportations: Adding chaos to dysfunction. Mr. Trump has a simple plan to reduce the population of 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States: Deport them. How? He says he would follow the example of the military-style roundups authorized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954. The initiative, known as Operation Wetback, expelled hundreds of thousands of Mexicans.

Spanning 1,000 miles along the southern border, it will stem the flow of immigrants bringing drugs and crime. And, yes, Mexico will pay for the Great Wall of Trump, as he has called it. But the wall - symbolic of an iron-fisted immigration policy and providing a rallying cry for his supporters - has proved to be as divisive in theory as it would be in practice. And experts in domestic security, immigration policy and civil engineering say that building it would be a daunting task and cause more problems than it would solve. Mr. Trump has shared few details. He has said that the wall would be built from precast concrete and steel and that it could be 50 feet tall, if not higher. After calling for it to extend across the entire 2,000-mile southern border, he more recently said half that length could be sufficient because of natural barriers. He has pegged the cost at $4 billion to $12 billion, most recently settling on around $10 billion.\" [New York Times, 5/19/16 ] Wall-Building Experts Said Trump\\'s Cost Estimate Was Far Too Low, With One Estimating The Cost Would Be At Least $26 Billion. \"After calling for it to extend across the entire 2,000-mile southern border, he more recently said half that length could be sufficient because of natural barriers.

Running the numbers, Mr. Sternfeld said a 40-foot-tall concrete wall using a \\'post and panel\\' system that went 10 feet below the ground - to minimize tunneling - would cost at least $26 billion.

Water experts in the Southwest question how Mr. Trump\\'s border wall could accommodate those crucial flows and still provide the barrier he wants. Another complication is that a nearly 50-year-old treaty between Mexico and the United States prevents any construction that obstructs or diverts the flow of the waterways.

According to a source familiar with the meeting, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and communications director Hope Hicks met with officials from the White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) last Tuesday to discuss the mechanics of creating what is known as a protective pool - a rotating group of journalists who follow the candidate\\'s every move and report on his or her activities even on days with no public events. The selected journalists, or \\'poolers,\\' circulate to a wide group of outlets regular reports with up-to-the-minute information on the candidate\\'s movements and interactions similar to how the press covers the president.

Mitt Romney agreed to protective pool coverage in August 2012. During the 2008 campaign, a protective pool was formed around Barack Obama in June and around John McCain in July. Once a candidate has a protective pool, his or her every movement can be dissected by the press. As it stands, Trump has favored an unconventional campaigning style with large scheduled rallies - instead of fundraising or retail-style events with voters - that wouldn\\'t normally be pooled... Forming a protective pool to cover Trump could prove to be difficult given the candidate\\'s and his campaign\\'s treatment of the press covering him thus far. The campaign has severely limited the access reporters have at Trump\\'s events, confining journalists to a pen during his speeches and barring them from approaching the rope line as he exits. Trump\\'s tightly controlled press operation differs from many campaigns - a small group of aides, and Trump himself, reportedly handle many inquiries.

Trump. As a former 27-year defense attorney, I can tell you the opportunities for tax abuse in this crowd are as predictable as they are inviting. Trump has been waffling recently on whether he\\'ll release his tax returns, which has prompted much speculation about what he might be hiding in them. People have mentioned potential crooked real estate deals, an embarrassingly low tax rate and foreign investments. But their searches will lead nowhere. If you want to discover fraud, don\\'t bother plumbing the depths of his real estate deals. The thousands of pages of mumbo jumbo associated with one hotel deal or another probably don\\'t reveal anything. These finances are handled by attorneys and accountants on both sides and are pretty routine. And you cannot embarrass Trump by pointing to his likely next-to-zero tax rate. As a real estate developer, Trump undoubtedly uses every lawful financial tool available to bring his taxes as close as possible to zero. More power to him; that is the American way. Foreign investments? Plainly, he will just blame those on the Democrats. No, none of these areas is likely to bear any fruit. That\\'s because, to expose a wrong-hearted real estate developer as a tax cheat, it is often more important to focus not on what the developer reports on his returns, but on what he leaves off.\" [Politico Magazine, 5/18/16 ] Trump\\'s Tax Returns Would Potentially Show Avoiding Personal Expenses By Having His Companies Pick Up The Tab. \"No, none of these areas is likely to bear any fruit. That\\'s because, to expose a wrong-hearted real estate developer as a tax cheat, it is often more important to focus not on what the developer reports on his returns, but on what he leaves off. You see, the goal of tax cheats is usually not to save money for some corporation, but to avoid using their own shekels to pay for personal expenses. Why pay for their own homes, food, golf rounds, cars or flights-or the taxes thereon-when their companies can pick up the tab? But personal expenses charged to a company counts as compensation, and failing to report such perks as taxable income is illegal. This kind of personal and professional line-blurring is a hallmark of the real estate tax cheat-those people who control whole construction firms, golf courses and hotel crews and who don\\'t get 1099s and W-2s for all the work they order and the perks they get. Perhaps the most famous example of this kind of fraud comes from New York real estate billionaire Leona Helmsley, who, in 1989 was convicted of having her real estate company pay for personal improvements, including a new dance floor, at her 21-room weekend home in Connecticut, without paying taxes on such benefits. (Helmsley, by the way, is famous for saying, \\'We don\\'t pay taxes. Only little guys pay taxes.\\')\" [Politico Magazine, 5/18/16 ] Trump\\'s Tax Returns Would Reveal Whether He Personally Paid For Mar-A-Lago In 1985, And Whether He Paid For Improvements To His \"Private Quarters\" At The Resort. \"Any scrutiny should focus first on Mar-A-Largo, Trump\\'s weekend and vacation oasis in Palm Beach, Florida, and former estate of Marjorie Merriweather Post. As the East Coast financial elite will attest, having a second home for leisure in Palm Beach is a pretty expensive luxury. Trump explains the financial status of Mar-A-Largo on the home page of the Mar-A-Largo website: \\'Since purchasing this landmark in 1985, I spend many weekends and holidays at this home away from home. When I made it a club in 1995, (126 rooms made it a very big house), I kept private quarters and designed the club to provide the best amenities possible for our members.\\' The relevant questions are few and should be quite easy for Trump to answer and to prove: Did Trump pay personally when he bought Mar-A-Largo in 1985? During the time that it was his personal vacation residence from 1985-1995, did his company deduct any of the acquisition costs, real estate taxes, insurance or utilities as a corporate expense? In other words, did he and his family alone live in this vacation home for 10 years while having the government and the rest of us pay for all or some as a business expense? Or, if a corporation bought Mar-A-Largo and provided it as a corporate perk, did Trump pay taxes on the benefit? For the past 20 years since Mar-A-Largo has functioned as a club, how much has Trump personally paid for his \\'private quarters,\\' his \\'home away from home,\\' any improvements thereto, and for his staff, food and golf in Palm Beach? Once again, were these amenities provided as a corporate perk? If so, did Trump pay the millions of dollars that would be owed in taxes on this income?\" [Politico Magazine, 5/18/16 ] Trump\\'s Tax Returns Would Show Whether He Or His Company Paid For His Condo In Trump Tower. \"Second, his primary residence at Trump Tower: Did Trump personally pay for his condo, and does he pay for the condo fees, utilities, improvements and expenses?

And then, of course, there\\'s personal air travel, which we know Trump does often. Is Trump\\'s plane a personal or corporate jet?

The press statement that accompanied the filing appears, and I really mean appears, to unwrap the enigma by acknowledging what I had suspected all along: That what the Donald\\'s been calling his \\'income\\' is actually revenue. I\\'ll tell you why this matters, but first, a little history. When the Trump campaign the filed the candidate\\'s first (PFD) last July, the press release stated that \\'Mr. Trump\\'s income for the year 2014 is $362 million dollars (which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties).\\' On the form titled \\'Filer\\'s Employment Assets and Income,\\' Trump fills 35 pages with what\\'s clearly gross receipts from such items as \\'condo sales,\\' \\'golf related revenue,\\' \\'commissions,\\' \\'management fees,\\' and \\'sales.\\' It\\'s the these items that totals $362 million, which Trump claimed as \\'income.\\' That definition conforms to the FEC\\'s requirements. Keep in mind that for almost all other candidates, even the super-rich, \\'income\\' mainly consists of their salaries plus capital gains, dividends, and the like from personal investments. But Trump is essentially reporting as a giant holding company that owns golf courses; rental, office, and condo buildings; brokerage and construction management enterprises.

Instead, they are put in a variety of categories ranging from a 2015 loan for more than $50m to less than $201 in income from his 2007 book Think Big and Kick Ass. But the filing demonstrates a number of interesting investments by Trump. Despite his frequent tirades against Oreo cookies for moving some production to Mexico and his pledge to boycott the popular cookie, Trump earned between $5,000 and $15,000 in interest on bonds in Mondelez, the holding company which owns Oreo.

This is from Dave Meko\\'s (quite nice!) statistics lecture notes: [1]~dmeko/notes_8.pdf See page 2, section 8.1. He provides two (in reality, as I mentioned before, there are really 3!) basic boundary constraints on a smooth (ie, in \"filtering\"). The first method he refers to is what I called the \"minimum norm\" constraint (assuming the long-term mean beyond the boundary). The second, which he calls \"reflecting the data across the endpoints\", is the constraint I have been employing which, again, is mathematically equivalent to insuring a point of inflection at the boundary. This is the preferable constraint for non-stationary mean processes, and we are, I assert, on very solid ground (preferable ground in fact) in employing this boundary constraint for series with trends... mike At 05:20 PM 9/5/2003 +0100, Phil Jones wrote: Mike, Attached some more plots. 1.

The senator\\'s team has spoken openly in recent weeks about their plans to push for a more progressive platform in Philadelphia come July. But campaign advisers are also looking at ways to make permanent changes to the rules his supporters see as designed to preclude outsiders like Sanders, particularly in the caucus system. The proposals under consideration would take aim at the structure, administration, and transparency of caucuses in key nominating states like Iowa and Nevada, according to senior advisers to the Sanders campaign. Other options include motions to modify the controversial superdelegate system — which allows Democratic insiders to put their thumbs on the scale — as well as closed primaries and party matters such the setup of committees at the national convention. Sanders himself has kept his focus trained on the primary\\'s final contests. But advisers also recognize that his path now leads to a symbolic but not insignificant fight in Philadelphia. What remains unclear inside the campaign is how and where Sanders would apply the strength of his \"political revolution.\" Some argue that the senator has a choice to make, as one senior adviser put it, between \"feel-good changes to the platform and fundamental changes to the nominating process.\" Sanders has already waded into both sides of the fight. Over the weekend, he sent a letter to the chair of the Democratic Party, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that accused the DNC of denying his backers equal representation on the crucial platform drafting committee. Meanwhile, signaling an interest in voting reform, the campaign backed an effort by Maine Democrats to move away from the superdelegate system. Officials stress that Sanders has yet to consider what he put to the Rules and Bylaws Committee, the body that would such consider changes, but the ideas could range from the convention setup to the way the DNC handles access to the party\\'s shared voter file. (Earlier this year, the Sanders campaign sued the DNC after several of their aides improperly accessed Clinton data made visible to them by a glitch in the system\\'s vendor.) Most of the ideas circulating inside the campaign involve voting reform. One possibility, the senior advisers said, would be the implementation of Republican-style \"firehouse\" caucuses in place of the less straightforward Democratic system. The difference, in essence: Democratic caucuses require participants to publicly state their preference. Under the \"firehouse\" caucuses, votes are cast by secret ballot, allowing for a final tally. The Sanders camp is also weighing a move to specifically target caucus reporting requirements. The Iowa Democratic Party, for instance, reports the number of delegates apportioned at a given caucus site, but not the total number of caucus participants or the number of caucus-goers drawn by each candidate. Earlier this year, after the release of final reporting breakdowns in Iowa, Sanders tried pressuring the state party to release its raw vote totals. Democratic caucuses have suffered badly this year amid turnout from the Sanders-Clinton race. Frustration and confusion in Iowa and Nevada, the highest-profile caucuses on the Democratic calendar, were commonplace — as were overcrowded and overwhelmed caucus sites in states where Sanders won, such as Maine. Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a recent interview with BuzzFeed News\\' politics podcast that she\\'d like to see caucuses eliminated from the Democratic nominating calendar. (She also said that\\'s not likely to happen.) The Clintons have also long expressed private frustration with the caucus system. In a 2012 email , released last year by the State Department, Clinton described caucuses as \"creatures of the parties\\' extremes.\" Prominent Clinton supporters have also expressed reservations with the caucus system this year. \"I think we should look at all this after this is over, after this cycle,\" Sen. Al Franken said on Wednesday in an interview. Franken, one of Clinton\\'s top surrogates, argued that caucuses may work when candidates can focus on a single state, but that in contests at the end of the calendar like his home state of Minnesota, caucuses should change. \"You can go to Iowa and meet enough people in Iowa for it to be significant that they have a caucus system,\" Franken said. \"By the time you get to Minnesota, Bernie or Hillary can\\'t spend that much time to go to one — you know, one bean feed after another.\" Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org', \"Dear Account User, This message is from the Office of the Information Technology Services (ITS) to all webmail account owners.

Eric has his press calls, I have my bookings, she has this surrogate database. The premise behind her surrogate database actually makes a lot of sense, that official DNC surrogates need to be vetted before going live. The problem she has is that someone who will for now remain nameless for the moment promised Brooklyn 1,000 vetted surrogates by 1 June. That same someone force-fed through approvals the creation of the most meat-headed sign-up form in the history of the Internet as the gateway to surrogacy. Then Community Engagement stepped up promising to get the database populated (sound familiar? e-hem, Hispanic summit). CE did not deliver. Jen is now at a little over 600 surrogates (not sure how many are actually vetted) and starting to freak out. The database is already populated with low-hanging fruit — DNC members, national, and state party officials and so on. I told her regionals don't really use surrogates beyond what she already has. She told me Lindsey Reynolds will come by and yell at us if we don't do what she says. I laughed really hard. To bring it full circle — Just like media monitoring isn't my job, this isn't our job.

I believe strongly that this program is masquerading as a way to help teens and their families, when really what it is doing is continuing to line the pockets of drug companies. I am very concerned that out of 100 students, 37 teens tested \"positive.\" Come on! That\\'s completely outrageous! Thirty-seven out of 100 teens test positive for mental problems?! Parents need only to look at those numbers and see the obvious objective of this program: trolling for business. Ms. Sattler could not have expressed my thoughts more clearly if she tried: teen suicide is devastating, but TeenScreen will only makes things worse by undermining families and mislabeling teens.

A video created by the DNC shows that it\\'s not only Democrats who are opposing the Republican-backed HB 2 in North Carolina. Many well-known conservative pundits have described the state\\'s so-called \"bathroom bill\" as \"a solution in search of a problem.\" However, that hasn\\'t stopped Republican Governor Pat McCrory, who remains firmly entrenched in his support for one of the most anti-LGBT pieces of legislation in the U.S. ever passed.

One key difference: \"Even a jaded Spurs fan like myself [and your PI author!] is proud of what Leicester was able to accomplish.

POLITICO\\'s Alex Isenstadt reports that in interviews Wednesday, not one out of dozens of major GOP donors would commit to donating to Trump. Bloomberg\\'s Zachary Mider adds Ted Cruz benefactors the Wilks family of Texas to the list of donors who say they will never back Trump.  SURGE PRICING: The Our City Our Safety Our Choice PAC in Austin, Texas, is calling for an investigation into Uber and Lyft\\'s tactics, such as allegedly offering discounted rides for votes, supporting a ballot measure to remove regulations. KVUE\\'s Ashley Goudeau reports the companies spent a combined $8.8 million. Residents took to Twitter earlier this week to air their frustrations when Uber began to mass text customers on their personal cellphones encouraging them to vote yes.  THE YEAR OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE: Bloomberg\\'s Bill Allison reports political organizations have already raised more than $135 million this year different state ballot initiatives - a 74 percent increase from this time during the 2014 cycle. There are about 817 ballot initiatives across the country this year, according to Ballotpedia, up from 616 in 2014. In California, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation has spent $5.9 million in its sponsorship of a pair of initiatives to cap the price state agencies pay for prescription drugs and to require performers in adult films to wear condoms. To defeat the drug measure, rival group the Californians Against the Misleading RX Measure has raised $39 million, entirely funded by pharmaceutical firms. Other groups focused on state ballot initiatives include Select Management Resources LLC, parent of the lender LoanMax on lending issues in South Dakota, the Service Employees International Union on insurance regulations in Massachusetts and California, a group called ColoradoCareYES on a single- payer health plan in Colorado, and more.  GUNS EX MACHINA: The Christian Science Monitor\\'s Joshua Eaton reports that the Obama administration is stoking the fire surrounding the \"smart gun debate,\" releasing a joint report last week on the administration\\'s efforts to research smart-gun technology preventing the use of weapons by unauthorized users. The National Rifle Association argues a mandate would open the door to stricter regulations, government tracking, safety-threatening glitches and hacking. There is currently legislation in New Jersey to update the state\\'s smart-gun law, and the Smart Gun Tech Challenges Foundation, a group of investors and entrepreneurs founded in 2014, currently funds 15 projects focused on gun safety technology.  SISTER ACT: At their annual meeting in Charlotte, N.C., Duke Energy shareholders will vote today on a proposal mandating the company disclose more information about its lobbying efforts. The Charlotte Observer\\'s Bruce Henderson reports the proposal came from Mercy Investment Services, which represents the sisters of two Catholic orders that hold Duke stock, the Sisters of Mercy and the Benedictine Sisters of Virginia. The sisters are asking for an annual report on Duke\\'s lobbying policies, spending specifics and disclosure of membership in groups that write model legislation, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, of which Duke will not say if it is a member. Management opposes the proposal, arguing it\\'s unnecessary as the firm already files required lobbying reports.

Police Investigate Possible Hate Crimes in Fremont July 29, 2007 07:45 AM CDT Some of the writings have contained swastikas. FREMONT -- Police in Fremont are investigating possible hate crimes directed at the NAACP. Detectives say some one is throwing propaganda into several people\\'s yards, with some of the writings targeting Dallas Leake, president of the Fremont chapter of the NAACP, and a former school board member. Since May, Leake has found disturbing notes in his yard. One was written on the sports page of The (Toledo) Blade newspaper, with the words \"national association for the advancement of complaining people.\" Below that was a reference to the \"n-word.\" Another threat, written on pages of a local Hispanic newspaper, said, \"Special delivery to the pres. of the Fremont chapter of NAACP.\" \"You have the right to voice your opinion but when you infringe on someone else\\'s right and actually you become a threat to their safety and to their family\\'s safety, I think is a different story,\" said Leake. When asked whether he fears for his safety, Leake answered, \"Of course. Of course. Not so much myself, but I have a wife and family.\" The letters also contain swastikas and praise for Adolph Hitler. The hateful messages have been tossed into yards and sidewalks, and seem to be increasing in recent days. \"They are rolled up in newspapers to weight them, so people think they are newspaper deliveries,\" said Sgt. Ken Buchele of the Fremont Police Department. \"They will go out and open it up, and lo and behold, there\\'s a hate propaganda.\" Many of the letters contain web addresses for the National Socialist Movement, the same pro-Nazi group that sparked riots in north Toledo back in 2005. \"You got all walks of life in a small town like this, you know,\" said Darren Lee, a Fremont resident. \"If you got a problem with somebody, you know, I feel settle it as adults, don\\'t be childish.\" \"It\\'s all over. It\\'s not just happening in Fremont,\" said Tyrone Lee, another Fremont resident. \"It\\'s all over America, all over the world. Everybody just needs to get along.\" Police aren\\'t sure who\\'s actually behind the letters but they are increasing patrols around Leake\\'s house.

The individual curves (Tornetrask, Taimyr and Yamal) have not been calibrated against their local temperature records yet, and so only exist as standardised (or normalised) anomalies. For the calibrated Tornetrask record of Briffa et al. (1992), the calibrated reconstruction made use of both tree-ring width and tree-ring density and so it will look different to the ring-width only record shown in the PAGES newsletter recently. For the earlier extension to this record, only ring-width will be available - which is why the calibrated record cannot be simply extended with the new data. Instead, a new calibration needs to be made, using ring-width only. This hasn't been done yet, and - while it *might* be a simple linear regression - sometimes ring-widths from one year and from the previous year are used together as predictors, so I cannot guarantee that it will be a simple rescaling of the uncalibrated curve. Nevertheless, the uncalibrated curve *is* correlated with summer temperature, so it certainly provides useful information. The average of the three series was calibrated *after* they were averaged, and was calibrated against the April-September mean temperature over all land north of 20N. This was purely for comparison with the other curves shown in our Science piece; for this curve, this region is by no means the optimum, and the temperature anomalies would no doubt differ in magnitude if a regional temperature from northern Eurasia had been used instead. This offers one explanation of why the 650-750 warming differs from Briffa et al. (1992). The second is that only ring-width has been used. The third reason is that it is the average of 3 curves - if the other two don't show the warming, or not as strongly, then of course the signal will be less pronounced in the average. So, you can still use the Briffa et al. (1992) calibration - it is certainly not wrong. Hope this helps with your choice of what to use. We will send you a reprint to your Middletown address when they arrive. I am now going to mail you hard copy (black & white) of the Tornetrask uncalibrated ring-width record (annual and 50-yr smoothed) from the PAGES article, and also a hard copy of the calibrated northern Eurasia record from the Science paper. The northern Eurasian record should preferably be referenced using both Briffa & Osborn and Briffa et al.

You have to look at judgment, knowledge and character. Touts Fiorina's record, rising from secretary to CEO. Said she has spent her life shattering glass ceilings. Adds that she understands that threats that face the country. Cruz: VP should be able to hold back the urges of an irresponsible teenager. You want someone who is honest who will stand up and tell the truth and knows that they believe. Carly is an exceptional leader who we can trust. Carly terrifies Hillary Clinton. I can picture HRC thinking about Carly tossing and turning in her jail cell. Talks about his tenure on Norte Dame's Commission on Catholic Education in the Hispanic Community. Goes on to talk about the importance of school choice. Donald Trump came out in support of Obama and Hillary Clinton of allowing grown men to use the little girls bathroom. If Donald Trump dresses as Hillary Clinton, he still can't use the little girls restroom. People ask, why I named Carly early. Cites Carly as a uniter. Also notes that he wants to present a clear contrast. Goes on to talk about issues Donald Trump and Hillary agree on—cites raises taxes, Obamacare individual mandate, support for Planned Parenthood Hits Trump for donating to Hillary. -- This election will come down to jobs, freedom and security. Cruz: lift the boot of the necks of small business. Cruz: If I am elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. We will pass health insurance that's personal, portable and affordable. We will pass a simple flat tax so that every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard. After we do that, we should abolish the IRS. Cruz: we're going to rein in the EPA, federal agencies that have descended like locusts killing jobs all across the country. We're going stop amnesty, secure the border. We're going to end sanctuary cities, welfare benefits for those here illegally. Goes on to say that will bring back manufacturing jobs from China and Mexico.. We're going to see manufacturing jobs coming back Next important thing at stake is freedom. Says two branches hang in the balance in this election. Goes on to talk about different rights at stake if another liberal Supreme Court justice is appointed. Guns rights, religious liberty, sovereignty and school choice Hits Trump for suggesting he would compromise religious liberty and second amendment rights to keep and bear arms. Adds that he's been supporting left wing Democratic politicians for 40 years. Cruz: I give you my solemn commitment that every justice I appoint will be a principled constitutionalist that will protect the Bill of Rights. I will not compromise your religious liberty or right to keep and bear arms. Cruz hits Trump for saying he would be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. Adds that he will stand unapologetically with Israel. Talks about how readiness and morale in the military has plummeted. Goes on to talk about how he will rebuild the military by repealing Obamacare, adopting a flat tax and stopping amnesty. Cruz: no longer will our military be governed by political correctness. Criticizes President Obama for not saying radical Islamic terrorism. Cruz: We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. To the jihadist, your day of reckoning is coming. Speaks out against the rules of engagement that he says is tying the hands of our military men and women. Cruz: If military force is needed we should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and get the heck out. We started with 17 candidates, young dynamic candidates. Democratic field consist of a wild-eyed socialist with views that are dangerous for America and the world and Bernie Sanders. Cruz: We're seeing Republicans coming together and uniting behind this campaign. 60-75% of Republicans recognize that nominating Donald Trump would be a train wreck.

Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations. But that obscures the different modes of promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense of the word. But their motives and behavior are quite different. Langur monkeys were the example in the cited article. \"Dominant males .. kill babies that are not their own.\" \"The dominant male monkey .. seeks to defend his harem of females.\" But cozying up to the current dominant male isn\\'t the best strategy for female langurs, because \"dominant males are dethroned by rivals every 27 months or so.\" \"By mating with as many extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide,\" by the male who is likely next to rule the roost. Maybe it\\'s just me, but that doesn\\'t paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a better picture of that. ;-) _________________________________________________________________ Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger:', 'Agree Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org On Apr 27, 2016, at 8:10 PM, Freundlich, Christina > wrote: I think we should just do the first paragraph.

His returns, according to experts, would answer a number of outstanding questions about whether Trump is paying his fair share and offer a true measure of his personal wealth and his charitable giving. Never mind that Donald Trump is now backtracking on his previous commitment to transparency. When Trump first considered running for President in 1999, he said he, \"probably wouldn\\'t have a problem with\" releasing his tax returns if he ran. Later, in 2012, he said if you\\'re running for President, \"at a minimum, probably, you\\'re going to have to show your [tax] returns\" and they should be released by April 1st of the election year. Washington Post Fact Checker: Trump\\'s false claim that \\'there\\'s nothing to learn\\' from his tax returns \"Trump falsely claims that voters would learn nothing from his tax returns. To the contrary, voters would learn a lot of information that Trump has long tried to hide from the public. Tax returns would help lift a veil of secrecy about Trump\\'s finances - and let voters know whether his claims about his wealth and charitable giving are true, or if he\\'s just a bombastic man behind the curtain akin to the Wizard of Oz. Four Pinocchios.\" Wall Street Journal: Criticism Grows Over Trump\\'s Withheld Tax Returns \"Mr. Trump has offered shifting explanations for his lack of disclosure, including the fact that his returns were currently under audit. He said voters aren\\'t interested in the returns. And he said they don\\'t reveal wealth. That\\'s true, but they would show information about his sources of income, his aggressiveness in tax planning and his charitable deductions. Mr. Trump claims a net worth exceeding $10 billion, though independent estimates peg that far lower. Mr. Thorndike, who directs the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit tax policy center, said the tradition of presidential and other candidates releasing returns exists for a reason. \\'It\\'s the principle of the disclosure, that someone running for the highest office in the land and someone who incidentally would be making sure that the rest of us live up to our tax obligations, should be willing to show us that he lives up to his,\\' Mr. Thorndike said.\" Washington Post: Trump, prompting criticism, indicates he may not release tax returns before Election Day \"Former GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who has been one of his party\\'s most vocal critics of Trump, called Trump\\'s decision not to release returns \\'disqualifying\\' in a statement release on social media. \\'It is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters, especially one who has not been subject to public scrutiny in either military or public service,\\' Romney wrote. \\'Mr. Trump says he is being audited. So? There is nothing that prevents releasing tax returns that are being audited.\\' Romney has previously accused Trump of attempting to conceal a \"bombshell\" by withholding the release of his taxes, which he repeated again Wednesday. Romney\\'s hesitation to release his own tax returns became an issue in the 2012 campaign.\" Boston Globe: Trump says he won\\'t release tax returns \"Trump\\'s refusal to agree to release the documents prompted an immediate backlash from both Democrats and Republicans, including a harsh condemnation from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. ... Modern presidential candidates have grown accustomed to releasing documentation so voters can make informed decisions about their qualifications. The candidates release letters from their physicians that provide some details about their health, and usually release financial information as well. Trump himself was a major force pushing President Obama to release his birth certificate - and he also criticized Romney for not releasing his taxes earlier in 2012.\" U.S. News and World Report: Trump Still Won\\'t Release Tax Returns \"A closer look at Trump\\'s finances might also feed skepticism of Trump\\'s claim he is worth $10 billion. A businessman overseeing a vast real estate empire - albeit with multiple failed companies and four bankruptcies on his resume - Trump\\'s tax returns won\\'t reveal the true amount of his wealth, but they could clear up other lingering questions. In February, when Trump\\'s taxes surfaced as a campaign issue, David Cay Johnston, author of \\'Perfectly Legal: the Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit the Super Rich - and Cheat Everybody Else,\\' detailed the kind of damning information Trump\\'s full tax returns could potentially contain. Not only could the public learn his income and the scope of his charitable giving -which has been called into doubt - the returns could indicate whether Trump is leveraging his assets and thus vulnerable to defaulting on his debts.

Best, Doyle ___________________ ARTICLE TEXT: Debate heats up over screening teens for suicide risk A growing number of U.S. schools are screening teenagers for suicidal tendencies or signs of mental illness, triggering a debate between those who seek to reduce the toll of youthful suicides and others who say the tests are unreliable and intrude on family privacy. The trend is being aggressively promoted by those who say screening can reduce the tragedy of the more than 1,700 suicides committed by children and adolescents each year in the United States. Many of the most passionate supporters have lost children to suicide -- among them Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., whose son Garrett died in 2003. One screening program, TeenScreen, has been administered to more than 150,000 children in 42 states. New York plans to start screening 400,000 children a year, and the federal government is directing tens of millions of dollars to expand screening nationwide. Use of the psychological evaluations is growing even though there is little hard evidence that they prevent suicides. A panel of government experts concluded two years ago that the evidence to justify suicide screening was weak. The growing use of screening has coincided with a rapid increase in the number of youngsters being prescribed powerful anti-psychotic medications such as Risperdal and Zyprexa that have not been specifically approved for use by children. Proponents say screening is no different from having health checkups or visiting a dentist, and that the potential benefits are incalculable. After Smith's son killed himself, the Republican bucked the objections of conservative groups to push into a law an $82 million effort to expand programs such as TeenScreen. Because suicide victims often turn out to have had mental disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder, David Shaffer of Columbia University, who developed the TeenScreen questionnaire, and other specialists say identifying and treating youngsters with such disorders may reduce the number of suicides. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Hopefully he\\'ll be properly back in November. Regarding Yamal, I\\'m afraid I know very little about the whole thing -- other than that I am 100% confident that \"The tree ring data was hand-picked to get the desired result\" is complete crap. Having one\\'s integrity questioned like this must make your blood boil (as I\\'m sure you know, with both of you having been the target of numerous such attacks). Though it would be nice to shield Keith from this during his recovery, I think Keith will already have heard about this because he had recently been asked to look at CA in relation to the Kaufman threads (Keith was a co-author on that and Darrell had asked Keith to help with a response to the criticisms). Apart from Keith, I think Tom Melvin here is the only person who could shed light on the McIntyre criticisms of Yamal. But he can be a rather loose cannon and shouldn\\'t be directly contacted about this (also he wasn\\'t involved in the Yamal chronology being discussed, though he has been involved in a regional reconstruction that we\\'ve recently been working towards that uses these -- and more -- data).

As Phil mentioned, I was already aware of this. The Douglass et al. paper was rejected twice before it was finally accepted by IJC. I think this paper is a real embarrassment for the IJC. It has serious scientific flaws. I\\'m already working on a response. Phil can tell you about some of the other sordid details of Douglass et al. These guys ignored information from radiosonde datasets that did not support their \"models are wrong\" argument (even though they had these datasets in their possession). Pretty deplorable behaviour... Douglass is the guy who famously concluded (after examining the temperature response to Pinatubo) that the climate system has negative sensitivity.

Just two days ago, Politifact confirmed that ISIS and other terror groups are using clips of Donald Trump in recruiting videos. \"There are many titles you can affix to Donald Trump – sexist, racist, xenophobic, dangerous, liar, etc. – but Republican Chairman McCaul may have come up with a new one: ISIS recruiter.

The announcement, contained in a notice to the federal trial court in Washington, clears the way for a major terrorism trial in the nation\\'s capital, the first in the United States since 2015, barring a plea agreement by Abu Khattala. The decision ended a lengthy review after President Obama aired concerns in October that while he supported capital punishment in theory, he found it \"deeply troubling\" in practice. [Obama calls death penalty \\'deeply troubling ] The move marked somewhat of a shift for the Justice Department, one year after federal prosecutors last May secured a death sentence in a capital terrorism case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The department in November approved its first new capital prosecution under Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch — who called the death penalty an \"effective punishment\" before her Senate confirmation in April 2015 — against Noe Aranda-Soto, an illegal immigrant accused of human trafficking and murder in Texas. However, analysts said the government faced a difficult calculation in the Benghazi case, pointing to complex legal, political and national security concerns that have produced a mixed record in capital terrorism cases, and to a history in which no D.C. jury has ever imposed the death penalty. \"We do these on a case-by-case basis,\" a Justice Department official said, declining to elaborate. Legal observers noted challenges facing the U.S. government in bringing witnesses from Libya to testify in a U.S. courtroom amid sectarian conflict in the region. A trial date before U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper of the District has not been set. Abu Khattala commanded a brigade absorbed by the extremist anti-Western group Ansar al-Sharia, which carried out the attacks on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012, that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others, according to U.S. investigators. The U.S. government in January 2014 designated Abu Khattala a terrorist and Ansar al-Sharia, an armed militia that seeks to establish sharia law in Libya, a terrorist organization. [Meet Ahmed Abu Khattala, an alleged ringleader of the Benghazi attacks ] \"The department is committed to ensuring that the defendant is held accountable for his alleged role in the terrorist attack on the U.S. Special Mission and annex in Benghazi that killed four Americans and seriously injured two others, and if convicted, he faces a sentence of up to life in prison,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said in a statement Tuesday. Clinton\\'s Benghazi hearing in three minutes Play Video3:02 Here are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) The Obama administration authorized Abu Khattala\\'s capture in a June 2014 U.S. Special Operations raid in Libya after he was lured to a villa south of Benghazi. He pleaded not guilty after being indicted on 18 counts, including death-eligible charges of murder of an internationally protected person, murder of an officer or employee of the United States, killing a person in an attack on a U.S. facility and providing material support to terrorists resulting in death. In unsealing a July 2013 complaint with death-penalty-eligible charges, then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said that an investigation was ongoing and that the arrest \"proves that the U.S. government will expend any effort necessary to pursue terrorists who harm our citizens.\" A spokesman for Channing D. Phillips, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, referred questions about the decision by the attorney general\\'s office to the Justice Department. A.J. Kramer, federal public defender for D.C., declined to comment. [Benghazi suspect captured in secret raid ] The decision returned focus at least briefly to the criminal prosecution for an attack that remains politically charged — raised in Republican presidential debates and dramatized in a feature film released nationwide early this year. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, testifying in October before a House select committee investigating the attacks, repeated her categorical denials of the long-debunked charge that she impeded rescue attempts. However, a State Department review concluded that security was inadequate for Benghazi, and the issue has continued to spur partisan crossfire. [Fact-checking the Benghazi attacks ] In the Abu Khattala case, it remains unclear what impact a decision not to seek the death penalty might have on plea talks, even as national security concerns surrounding the prosecution persist. The situation is not unusual. The government\\'s record in capital terrorism cases has been mixed, with more success in cases brought against \"lone wolves\" acting on their own to kill on U.S. soil than in cases brought against foreign-based or foreign-trained fighters. Libya is in the midst of a civil war, complicating the investigation and raising questions about how much prosecutors will rely on classified evidence and on how any such disclosures might affect U.S. interests in the region. Prosecutors have already turned over about 20,000 pages of material to Abu Khattala\\'s defense at last notice, most of it is classified, and much of the government\\'s case remains secret. The Libyan government has previously protested the U.S. seizure of Abu Khattala as a violation of Libyan sovereignty. In court papers, U.S. authorities alleged that Abu Khattala told others he believed the American diplomatic presence in Benghazi was cover for a U.S. intelligence-gathering facility and vowed to \"do something about this facility.\" Abu Khattala drove with attackers to the U.S. diplomatic post and participated in the assault that began about 9:45 p.m. that night, \"coordinating the efforts of his conspirators and turning away emergency responders,\" prosecutors alleged. Stevens and State Department communications expert Sean Patrick Smith died of smoke inhalation after attackers set ablaze a villa containing a \"safe room\" at the compound. Near midnight, Abu Khattala allegedly entered a mission office and oversaw the looting of data about a nearby CIA annex that soon came under mortar fire, killing security contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. [Former CIA chief challenges the story line of Benghazi movie \\'13 Hours\\' ] Last year, a lawyer for Abu Khattala, standing next to the defendant, said in court that \"everyone agrees what happened in September 2012 was a tragedy and Americans suffered a tragic loss.\" Defense attorney Jeffrey D. Robinson added, \"Mr. Abu Khattala agrees it was a tragic loss but disagrees he is the person responsible for it.\" Death-penalty experts said they were not surprised at the government\\'s move, noting that terrorism prosecutions for the deaths of Americans remain extremely rare and highly case-specific. Federal prosecutors have sought the death penalty for an accused terrorist at least 14 times since 1993, but only one was executed — Timothy Mc\\xadVeigh, the 1995 Oklahoma City federal-building bomber. McVeigh is one of three people executed by the U.S. government since 1964. Tsarnaev, the most recent addition to federal death row, also is a U.S. citizen, of Chechen heritage, who purportedly was inspired by Islamist radicalism but not in contact with any organized group. Others who faced the death penalty but pleaded guilty and received life sentences include serial bomber Eric Rudolph, an avowed white supremacist convicted in 2005 for explosions at Atlanta\\'s Olympic Park in 1996 and at an Alabama abortion clinic, and Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who was convicted in 1998 of leading an 18-year-long anti-technology and anarchist crusade from his remote Montana cabin that killed three and injured 28. Since 2000, the U.S. government has failed to persuade federal juries to impose the death penalty in other high-profile cases. A jury in Alexandria, Va., in 2006 rejected the U.S. government\\'s four-year effort to obtain a death sentence against al-Qaeda conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen who received life in prison for conspiring in the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Manhattan jurors in 2001 deadlocked in the al-Qaeda-led bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 that killed 214 people, resulting in life sentences for a Saudi and a Tanzanian man convicted in the attacks. The Moussaoui prosecution in particular was criticized by some analysts from both the left and right. Conservative critics said the result highlighted the drawbacks of trying terrorists in civilian courts. Liberal experts said the government wasted years and millions of dollars seeking Moussaoui\\'s execution when a plea deal and life sentence was an option from the outset. The Daily 202 newsletter A must-read morning briefing for decision-makers. Other observers questioned whether U.S. pursuit of the death penalty helps or hinders foreign-government cooperation with U.S. counterterrorism efforts. \"There are tensions between public trials and national security,\" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, including what kinds of evidence can be admitted in a capital case and the need not to compromise anti-terrorism efforts abroad. \"This is a highly extraordinary case.\" The prospect of a death-penalty trial in Washington poses hurdles for both sides. Trying a foreign terrorist accused of the overseas killing of a senior U.S. diplomat and other federal employees could be expected to draw a sympathetic jury in Washington, seat of the national government. However, since Congress reinstated the federal death penalty in 1988, only a handful of eligible cases have gone to federal trial in the District, and none resulted in a death sentence.

Pollack Settlement Proposal Talk to outside counsel but my opinion is to stay firm and call his bluff.

The response was not good. Ben made the following points: Â 1. The holdback of 50% is ridiculously too high. They would want 85% upon signing of a short form. (I told him that if so, the short form would not be so short). 2. They will never agree to a time limit on the agreement – the deal with Mark would not end until the IGT deal finally ends. THIS IS THE BIG ONE. 3. On 6A(1), they want 20% until December 31, 2029. (I think that if SPT agreed to no termination date, they would agree to 20% until December 31, 2024). 4. On 6A(2), the 10% continues until the IGT deal finally ends. 5. On 6A(3), the 10% continues until the IGT deal finally ends. 6. 6A(4) would be deleted. 7. On 6B, they want to be sure that the indemnity provisions survive, that Pollack retains audit rights and the right to secure copies of records relevant to conducting an audit. They are confused as to 6B(3), and would want to discuss the length of such an agreement and what provisions would survive. If SPT/SPCP is free to use Pollack or not, they do not understand why any end date is needed. Â So, in the event SPT accepted such a deal, what would SPT have achieved? Â 1. Paid 7 of the 14 million as a compromise. 2. When the 2024 deal ends, reduce Pollack\\'s deal on gambling monies to 10%. 3. Reduce non-gambling monies to 10% now and going forward. 4. Limit the deal to WOF and Jeopardy! and no other properties. 5. Pollack to consult only upon SPT request – non audit related records not sent to Pollack. Confidentiality obligation imposed. Â Â I have asked our outside counsel to revisit the issue of whether SPT can legally terminate the deal at the end of 2024 and to revert to me this weekend.

I\\'m not going to forward exactly what the original letter said. One of the best things about this letter is that the writer put our true messages out there without forwarding the enemy\\'s lines. Look how smooth it is and how beautiful. This is kind of how we should write anti-psych letters as well. I hope you get what I\\'m saying. Read the letter and you\\'ll see. Best, Doyle Dialogue can lead to understanding In response to Deborah Riska\\'s letter (\"Do research before deciding on \\'church,\\'\" April 10) regarding the Church of Scientology here in Battle Creek, I\\'d like to acknowledge her observations of our presence, and a few of the programs that we have been undertaking in the community. As Scientologists, we feel that we have a commitment to contribute to the betterment of our community and the individuals in it. We also feel that each person\\'s personal involvement is on a much higher level than just sitting around waiting for someone else to do it. So yes, you will continue to see us out and about, doing our best to do something about it. It is maybe a sign of our times to distrust the efforts of others, and to feel the need to denigrate them. One sees this in the news all of the time - liberals bash conservatives, conservatives bash liberals; businesses bash unions, unions bash businesses. And where does this all eventually lead? Hatred, distrust, violence and even wars and death. Possibly, just possibly, this may be a good time to take another path. It may be that if we just worked a little harder to communicate with each other, to see who our neighbors are, we may find that they don\\'t actually bite, and may even be someone we would like to be friends with someday. This is a good community with a long history of tolerance, justice, health, and fairness. I pray that it does not slide into the hate, partisanship, name-calling and violence that consumes so much of the world. We can live together in an atmosphere of understanding and tolerance. And that begins with dialogue. I invite anyone in the community who wishes to engage in such a dialogue to stop in and say hello. The Rev.

The move came Friday after an independent investigation into Democratic presidential campaigns\\' handling of party voter data. The Sanders team said the investigation vindicated them and showed no evidence that they improperly accessed information belonging to Hillary Clinton \\'s campaign. \"An independent investigation of the firewall failures in the DNC\\'s shared voter file database has definitively confirmed that the original claims by the DNC and the Clinton campaign were wholly inaccurate,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"The Sanders campaign never \\'stole\\' any voter file data; the Sanders campaign never \\'exported\\' any unauthorized voter file data; and the Sanders campaign certainly never had access to the Clinton campaign\\'s \\'strategic road map.\\' The withdrawal of the lawsuits ends a months-long fight between Sanders and the Democratic party. In December, the DNC alleged that Sanders staffers had improperly accessed Clinton\\'s campaign information. A Sanders aide at the time denied wrongdoing, saying they had only tried to document the security error to alert the DNC. That initial finding prompted the party to briefly block the Sanders campaign\\'s access to party files and data. The Sanders campaign cried foul, accusing the DNC of tipping the scales to help front-runner Clinton less than two months before the Iowa caucuses. The DNC rejected those charges, arguing they were acting to keep campaign data secure. The final results of the investigation on Friday were not made public. But Sanders\\' campaign claimed the investigation showed the unauthorized access came from \"the DNC\\'s security failures\" and that only four campaign staffers, including one who was immediately fired, were aware they could access some of Clinton\\'s data for a one-hour window. The DNC said the investigation confirmed what they first learned. \"The forensic analysis conducted by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike confirmed that the DNC\\'s initial findings, which were the basis of the temporary shutdown in December, were accurate,\" said DNC communications director Luis Miranda in a statement. \"The audit confirmed that one campaign gained unauthorized access to the data of another, and the audit further confirmed that the results of those searches were saved within the system and that data was exported. Following the conclusion of the audit that confirmed the DNC\\'s original findings, the Sanders campaign withdrew its lawsuit.\" The DNC also provided a timeline that notes that the four Sanders staffers \"conducted 25 searches using proprietary Hillary for America score data across 11 states.\" Both sides acknowledge that one summary sheet with data related to New Hampshire appeared to have been saved off-site, but the Sanders campaign argued that the file did not exist on their computers and was never seen by any Sanders staffer. Sanders sits far behind Hillary Clinton in the delegate count and is effectively unable to steal the lead from her without convincing large numbers of superdelegates to switch their support.', 'Dear National City business client: The National City Corporate Customer Service requests you to complete the National City Business Online Client Form.

We\\'ve come so far and done so much, and it\\'s absolutely because you\\'ve been on the front lines fighting for the change we believe in, change that truly makes a difference in people\\'s lives. Our kids and grandkids are more likely to grow up in a world where their only limits are how big they\\'re willing to dream and how hard they\\'re willing to work. They\\'ll inherit a country with a growing economy, with opportunity to explore affordable higher educations options, with the chance to get a start in life without the overwhelming burden of health insurance costs because mom and dad can cover them for a few more years. And it\\'s worth pointing out, NAME: There are some folks who thought we\\'d never see this day. But your tenacity and your unwavering commitment to forming a more perfect union are what carried us through the most difficult parts of this journey. And I\\'m so proud be able to say I was there working with you. Right now, the next chapter of our country is entirely in your hands, NAME. And I have total faith that you\\'ll do great things because I\\'ve seen what you can do. But this moment is all about celebrating you, because you are the reason we\\'ve made it this far, and the reason we\\'ll keep doing the work that matters to make a difference. So, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so, so much. Michelle P. S. - The first step in continuing this fight long after Barack and the girls and I have left the White House is by electing leaders who want to fight with us. Add your name if you\\'re ready to do whatever it takes between now and November 8th to make sure we do it: LINK -v3(JGR)- Sender: Michelle Obama Subject: I write to you a lot, NAME, for so many different reasons. Sometimes I\\'m asking you to make a contribution to help get more Democrats elected across the country. Sometimes I\\'m asking you to take a stand against the Republicans who want to take Barack\\'s place in the Oval Office and undo all our hard work. But today, I want to say something else: Thank you. It goes unsaid too often by too many people, and I want to make sure I never ever forget to thank you for your commitment to Barack, and to this movement and the change we\\'re creating together. Because at the end of the day, that\\'s what this has all been about -- change we truly believe in, and change that we fight for. I\\'m so grateful that you\\'re on this team, fighting for our values, and fighting to improve the lives of millions of Americans. And I can\\'t tell you enough how much it means that you\\'ve stood by us for all these years, and that you\\'re going to continue to stand up for what we believe in long after Barack has left office. I know our work doesn\\'t end when the next president steps into the White House, and I know you\\'ll keep pushing this country forward with your passion and your commitment to our Democratic values of equality and opportunity for all. So today, add your name next to mine to say you\\'re ready for what\\'s next: LINK Once again: Thank you, NAME.

I am attaching a description of the method as we employ it. The current CDROM version uses only a SAR version of the UD-EBM. Of course, there is a TAR version that Sarah used for the TAR, developed by me and Sarah -- but mainly Sarah. This has not yet been put into MAGICC/SCENGEN, although I am in the process of doing so (along with making a number of other changes to the software). We do not normally give the code for TAR/MAGICC to others unless it is as part of a collaborative project. As Mike Hulme noted, what we can do for/with you will have to be a joint decision with me and Sarah. The issue of how well scaling works compared with a full AOGCM is both important and of considerable interest to me (and Ben Santer). It is something we have looked at in the past, cursorily, and which we were planning to investigate more fully with the suite of PCM runs that we have here. There are some tricky issues that need to be addressed. So, perhaps we should pool our intellectual, modelling and data resources? Anyhow, check out the attached and get back to me with your views. The \\'new and improved version\\' of MAGICC/SCENGEN should be available in beta-test form in about a month. It will have around 30 models in its data base, and it does a lot of new things that I can tell you about later.

More delegates, going to be nominee, but you have to grow. We're going after Clinton machine. Candidate Trump will expand the map. We're putting new states in play, MI, NY, MA, Indiana.

I don't want to get too far ahead of it. Great governors out there who are CEO of states. Need to follow that model, like Rick Scott in Florida. Jindal in Louisiana. Something to be said for balanced budget requirements. Two areas where conservatism federally successful, under Reagan and under Gingrich contract. People feel betrayed by DC. Time for a national campaign where everyone runs on set of principals? Good idea but you have to understand DC broken for 30 years. Reason Trump successful is because blue collar people want change. Trump can fundamentally change system. Trump has raised issues where opponents said you can't do that, but then they all take his side 3 weeks later. When Trump said I'll announce 14 people for Supreme Court to show conservatives he is serious, wouldn't that give people comfort knowing what will happen in first 100 days? He's laid out priorities on the campaign trail. He's done more events and media than anyone. Laid out people he would consider - Pryor, Diane Sykes (sp?). Difference is we have presidential candidates that can appoint up to 5 justices that can fundamentally change the way America works.

No president since James Madison, nearly 200 years ago, has seen the nation\\'s capital city successfully attacked. But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first great crisis of the 21st century. This is the president\\'s story of September 11th and the week America went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he remembers Sept. 11. \"I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for some around the world to forget the mission, but not me,\" Mr. Bush says during the Air Force One interview. \"Not me. I made the pledge to myself and to people that I\\'m not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So long as I\\'m president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.\" The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first hours after the attack. Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane been so central to America in a crisis. For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before 6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet engines echoed in Manhattan. Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One. \"I thought it was an accident,\" says Mr. Bush. \"I thought it was a pilot error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a terrible mistake.\" Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was a coordinated attack. Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the news on his pager. The president\\'s chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in. \"A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack,\" Card told the president When he said those words, what did he see in the President\\'s face? \"I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said,\" Card recalls. \"I think he understood that he was going to have to take command as commander-in-chief, not just as president.\" What was going through Bush\\'s mind when he heard the news? \"We\\'re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we\\'re going to do something about it,\" Mr. Bush recalls. \"I realized I was in a unique setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident that we were, you know, that the world had changed.\" Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first words to the nation. \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America,\" he said in the speech. \"Today, we\\'ve had a national tragedy.\" It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didn\\'t know that two more hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent ran in. \"He said to me, \\'Sir, we have to leave immediately\\' and grabbed, put a hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the door of my office,\" Cheney recalls. \"I\\'m not sure how they do it, but they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.\" \"There wasn\\'t a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice president,\" says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. \"We knew there were unidentified planes tracking in our direction,\" he says. Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice called Mr. Bush. \"It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get out of the West Wing,\" says Rice. \"They were hurrying me off the phone with the president and I just said, he said, \\'I\\'m coming back\\' and we said \\'Mr. President that may not be wise.\\' I remember stopping briefly to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, \\'I\\'m fine. You have to tell everybody that I\\'m fine\\' but then settling into trying to deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I think the thing that was on everybody\\'s mind was how many more planes are coming.\" The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the White House, no matter what. \"It\\'s important to emphasize it\\'s not personal, you don\\'t think of it in personal terms, you\\'ve got a professional job to do,\" says Cheney. Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the capital. Says Mineta: \"Someone came in and said \\'Mr. Vice president there\\'s a plane 50 miles out,\\' then he came in and said \\'Its now 10 miles out, we don\\'t know where it is exactly, but it\\'s coming in low and fast.\\'\" It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812. As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bush\\'s limousine sped toward Air Force One in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate. \"I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled \\'Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run,\\' and suddenly the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and the whole White House just flooded out,\" she recalls. In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling a Secret Service agent \"Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters protected.\" At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications Director Dan Bartlett was on board. \"It was like a rocket,\" he remembers. \"For a good ten minutes, the plane was going almost straight up.\" At the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche of steel, concrete and human lives. \"Someone said to me, \\'Look at that\\' I remember that, \\'Look at that\\' and I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and the horror of that moment,\" recalls Rice of the TV newscast. She also felt something in her gut: \"That we\\'ve lost a lot of Americans and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of course I felt the anger.\" Down in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11. As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether to shoot them down. \"I discussed it with the president,\" Cheney recalls. \"\\'Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked?\\' He said yes.\" \"It was my advice. It was his decision,\" says Cheney. \"That\\'s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot down your own civilian aircraft,\" says Bush. \"But it was an easy decision to make given the – given the fact that we had learned that a commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it was, I didn\\'t hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be done.\" The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. The flight was 15 minutes from Washington. \"Clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too,\" says Rice. Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of its twin. The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure location somewhere in Washington. \"I was horrified,\" she says. \"I thought, \\'Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can.\\' It was a nightmare.\" By 10:30 a.m., America\\'s largest city was devastated, its military headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf Coast. \"I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining moment in the history of the United States,\" says President Bush. \"I didn\\'t need any legal briefs, I didn\\'t need any consultations, I knew we were at war.\" Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, \"This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.\" \"I was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says the president. \"Information was just flying from all directions.\" Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bush\\'s ranch. \"I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of different information,\" says Card. They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, \"Angel is next.\" The threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman. \"It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get the president home,\" Tillman says. \"We actually have to consider everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to make sure that no one knows what our position is.\" Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from air traffic control – a suspect airliner was dead ahead. \"Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with,\" Tillman remembers. Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought that was a good idea, except the president. \"I wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back,\" says Bush. So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in Nebraska. Back in Washington, the president\\'s closest advisor, Karen Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. Bush. \"And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, sounded very shaken said, \\'Ma\\'am, I\\'m sorry, we can\\'t reach Air Force One.\\'\" Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didn\\'t recognize. \"There were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to see something like that in, in our nation\\'s capital,\" says Hughes. When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. \"I knew it was a day that you didn\\'t want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, \\'Hello?\\' and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to the location where I met the vice president.\" On Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He didn\\'t want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the telephone. \"We actually didn\\'t tell them our destination or what directions we were heading,\" says Tillman. \"We, we basically just talked to \\'em and said, \\'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly across the United States.\\'\" Controllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning each other to keep the route secret. \"OK, where\\'s he going?\" one tower radioed to another. \"Just watch him,\" a second tower responded. \"Don\\'t question him where\\'s he\\'s going. Just work him and watch him, there\\'s no flight plan in and we\\'re not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?\" Air Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed back: \"Air Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 o\\'clock position.\" \"The staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows,\" says Bartlett. \"And the president gives them a signal of salute, and the pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.\" The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander wouldn\\'t tell them where they were going. \"He just said, \\'You\\'ll know when you see it,\\' and that was my first clue, I didn\\'t have any idea what we were going up until that point,\" says Brotherton. He knew when he saw it. \"We, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force One, and we\\'d investigate anything that was within 80 miles,\" says Roberts. Bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this aircraft, or for his own safety: \"I looked out the airplane and saw two F-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to get us.\" We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He hadn\\'t appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, \"The American people want to know where their dang president is.\" The staff considered an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At 11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. \"The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless,\" Bush said to the nation from Barksdale. At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had a job for press secretary Fleischer. \"The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed,\" says Fleischer Fleischer\\'s notes capture Mr. Bush\\'s language, plain and unguarded. To the vice president he said: \"We\\'re at war, Dick, we\\'re going to find out who did this and kick their ass.\" Another time, Mr. Bush said, \"We\\'re not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.\" The President adds, \"I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I said, \\'We\\'re going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you and Dick Myers,\\' who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, \\'are going to go get them.\\'\" By 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that gave no hint of what they would find below. At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground Command Center. It was built to transmit a president\\'s order to go to nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent. According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls that Tenent answered: \"Sir, I believe its al Qaeda. We\\'re doing the assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.\" The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed. A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the seat numbers of the hijackers. \"That was the first piece of hard evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and going through a process of elimination,\" says Mueller. In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had enough. He decided to come back. \"At one point, he said he didn\\'t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him out of Washington,\" Fleischer says. \"That verbatim.\" On board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: \"I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that you\\'re guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.\" As Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America collapsed, one of the nation\\'s worst days wore into evening. At the World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead. \"Anybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would take innocent life the way they did, anybody who\\'s so devious, is evil,\" Bush said recently. Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the way to the White House. Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White House to return to? \"I don\\'t remember thinking about whether or not the White House would have been obliterated,\" he recalls. \"I think I might have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to take our best shot.\" Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff were already working on the speech. \"He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was reassurance,\" remembers Hughes. \"We had to show resolve, we had to reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.\" Just off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. Bush didn\\'t think the American people wanted to hear it that night and he was emphatic about that. He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty million Americans were watching. \"Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,\" he said from the Oval Office that night. The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White House daily log: \"The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. We think it\\'s Osama bin Laden.\" (CBS) When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the president would do. In office for just eight months, he\\'d never been tested as commander-in-chief. \"I never asked them what they thought,\" President Bush said of the Pentagon brass, \"because I didn\\'t really – because I knew what I was gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and bring them to justice.\" In the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: \"The deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war,\" he said. To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to strike bin Laden\\'s organization well before Sept. 11. \"The president said, \\'You know I\\'m tired of swatting at flies, I need a strategy to eliminate these guys,\\'\" Rice recalls. In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didn\\'t pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for came too late. Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for was \"literally headed to the president\\'s desk, I think, on the eleventh, tenth or eleventh, of September.\" On Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in the past. \"Well, there\\'s a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway,\" Mr. Bush tells Pelley. \"A lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than they should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense (Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what we called \\'boots on the ground.\\' That if you\\'re gonna go to war, then you\\'ve gotta go to war with all your assets.\" The president says he wanted to \"fight and win a guerilla war with conventional means.\" It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the Taliban government. Secretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an unconventional solution to an unconventional problem. \"As I like to describe it to my friends,\" Powell says, \"we had on the ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the best in the world. How do you connect it all?\" The president gave them 48 hours to figure it out. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day before, he had called the Pentagon the \"mightiest building in the world.\" Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch. The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker. \"He wasn\\'t real receptive to that, to that recommendation,\" remembers Brian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. \"And he ordered a hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening and that\\'s what he did.\" The next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the president. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause. \"He sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it,\" says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service later that morning. \"And I just scribbled a little note to him,\" Powell recalls, \"and I said, \\'Mr. President, I\\'ve learned over the years when you are going to give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will cause you to start to tear up.\\' He looked at me and he smiled and then at the next break in the conversation he said, \\'The Secretary of State told me not to break down at the memorial service,\\' and that broke the tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.\" First Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. \"I wanted the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.\" It also stirred the mourners\\' resolve, as Rice remember. \"As we stood to sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" she says, \"you could feel the entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve. \"We all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.\" Next came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for what he encountered there. \"You couldn\\'t brief me, you couldn\\'t brief anybody on ground zero until you saw it,\" Mr. Bush says. \"It was like – it was ghostly. Like you\\'re having a bad dream and you\\'re walking through the dream.\" The president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men and women at ground zero began to chant, \"USA! USA!.\" \"There was a lot of bloodlust,\" the president recalls. \"People were, you know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, \\'Don\\'t you ever forget this, Mr. President. Don\\'t let us down.\\' The scene was very powerful. Very powerful.\" When Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, \"We can\\'t hear you.\" The president responded, \"I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\" Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; he\\'d posed with the firemen who always stood by whenever the president\\'s helicopter landed there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the picture were dead – lost at ground zero. When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother. At a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several hundred of these families in a convention hall. \"People said to me, \\'He\\'ll come out. Don\\'t worry, Mr. president, we\\'ll see him soon. I know my loved one, he will - he\\'ll find a place to survive underneath the rubble and we\\'ll get him out.\\' I, on the other hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and cry, but I remember the whole time thinking, \\'This is incredibly sad because the loved ones won\\'t come out.\\'\" One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his firefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the boy, \"Your daddy won\\'t believe that I was here, so you show him that autograph.\" It was an effort \"to provide a little hope,\" the president recalls. \"I still get emotional thinking about it because we\\'re dealing with people who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved their…wives who loved their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my tears, I see opportunity.\" The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. The body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground zero. \"I called the police department,\" Howard remembers, \" and they said he hadn\\'t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, \\'No, I don\\'t need to call back.\\' If he hadn\\'t called in, I knew where he was.\" George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldn\\'t stay away. The police department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president. \"He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me,\" Howard recalls. \"And he extends his sympathy to me and that\\'s when I asked him I\\'d like to present George\\'s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who were killed over there.\" By the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained. \"He was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was emotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted,\" recalls Card.. The next day – Saturday, Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting. \"My message is for everybody who wears the uniform – get ready. The United States will do what it takes,\" Mr. Bush told them. As Powell remembers it, \"He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.\" President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. \"On the other hand,\" he says, \"I wanted to clarify plans and I went around the room and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.\" When he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the cabinet what he was planning. \"I wanted to just think it through,\" Mr. Bush remembers. \"Any time you commit troops to harm\\'s way, a president must make sure that he fully understands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just spend some time on it alone. And did.\" What were his reservations? Mr. Bush says, \"Could we win? I didn\\'t want to be putting our troops in there unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.\" Nine days after the attacks on America, before a joint session of Congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror. \"Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened,\" Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. \"We\\'ll remember the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end.\" A year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to remind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being waged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office, literally keeping score, one terrorist at a time. In his desk, the president says, \"I have a classified document that might have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about who\\'s out there, where they might be\" And as the terrorists are captures or killed? \"I might make a little check there, yeah,\" Mr. Bush admits. But there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list – Osama bin Laden. (CBS) A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago, the president was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. He had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now, on his orders, U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did not expect, in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week, CBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq, about whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Scott Pelley: You must be frustrated, maybe angry. After a year, we still don\\'t have Osama Bin Laden? President Bush: How do you know that? I don\\'t know whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive. I don\\'t know that. He\\'s not leading a lot of parades. And he\\'s not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he was. This is much bigger than one person anyway. This is — we\\'re slowly but surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that, that hates America. And we will stay on task until we complete the task. I always knew this was a different kind of war, Scott. See, in the old days, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his tanks or his airplanes and his ships. This is an international manhunt. We\\'re after these people one at the time. They\\'re killers. Period. Pelley: But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or alive? Mr. Bush: If he were dead, there\\'s somebody else to replace him. And we would find that person. But slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al Qaeda network. And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. And at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary so that people don\\'t feel like they\\'ve got to conduct terror to achieve objectives. Pelley: Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts? Certainly, we\\'ve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda has been scattered. But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have gotten away. And there have been many civilian casualties as well. Mr. Bush: Uh huh. Well, you know, I am sad that civilians lost their life. But I understand war. We did everything we can to — everything we could to protect people. When civilians did die, it was because of a mistake. Certainly not because of intention. We liberated a country for which I\\'m extremely proud. No, — I don\\'t second guess things. It\\'s — things never go perfect in a time of war. Pelley: Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein? Mr. Bush: I\\'m committed to regime change. Pelley: There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war in Iraq. Some of our allies in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Turkey for example. Even your father\\'s former national security advisor, Mr. Scowcroft has written about it in the paper. What is it in your estimation that they don\\'t understand about the Iraq question that you do appreciate? Mr. Bush: The policy of the government is regime change, Scott, hasn\\'t changed. I get all kinds of advice. I\\'m listening to the advice. I appreciate the consultations. And we\\'ll consult with a lot of people but our policy hasn\\'t changed. Pelley: On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil. Mr. Bush: Yeah. Pelley: I don\\'t think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same time, many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for political reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the oil region of the Middle East. Is there any change in foreign policy that you\\'re considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United States. Mr. Bush: Hmm. Well, I\\'m working for peace in the Middle East. I\\'m the first president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly declared the need to have a Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace. I\\'ve made it clear that in order for there to be peace the Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror and believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns. I\\'ve also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that they\\'ve got responsibilities. If you want peace they gotta work toward it. We\\'re more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it as well. But all this business isn\\'t going to happen as long as a few are willing to blow up the hopes of many. So we all gotta work to fight off terror. Pelley: Arafat has to go? Mr. Bush: Either, he\\'s, he\\'s been a complete failure as far as I am concerned. Utter disappointment. Pelley: There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties. Mr. Bush: Yeah… Pelley: In fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your administration\\'s decision to close certain deportation hearings. They said, quote, \"A government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to the Constitution.\" Where do you draw the line sir? Mr. Bush: I draw the line at the Constitution. We will protect America. But we will do so on, within the guidelines of the Constitution, confines of the Constitution, spirit of the Constitution. Pelley: Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you as an idea that you\\'ve thought, \"No, that\\'s too far. I don\\'t wanna go…\" Mr. Bush: Nah, not that that I remember. And I am pleased with the Justice Department. I think that Attorney General\\'s doing a fine job, by the way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure that they review decisions we make, I think that\\'s fine. I mean, that\\'s good. It\\'s healthy. It\\'s part of America. Pelley: Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of four freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want and freedom from fear. Do we have that today Mr. President? Freedom from fear? Mr. Bush: I think more than we did, in retrospect. The fact that we are on alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us more free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th. We\\'ve got more work to do. Pelley: And Americans should not live their lives in fear? Mr. Bush: I don\\'t think so. No. I think Americans oughta know their government\\'s doing everything possible to help. And obviously if we get information that relates directly a particular attack we\\'ll deal with it. And if we get noise that deals with a general attack, we\\'ll alert people. There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny and run down leads. And the American people need to go about their lives. It seems like they are.', \"Tracy, I need to know what the consolidated to Enron numbers are for ETS, PGG, and the other portions of Stan's world (if material), accrual-wise.
