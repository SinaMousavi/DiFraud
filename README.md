## Report on Implementation of Deep Learning Algorithms on DiFraud Dataset

**The purpose of this task is to evaluate the performance of different deep learning algorithms on the DiFraud dataset, which is available on Hugging Face. DiFraud is designed to detect fraudulent activities, and we aim to compare the effectiveness of various models in identifying these activities.**
